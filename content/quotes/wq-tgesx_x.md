  Far too many Christians live their spiritual life on the “battery system.”
  Lest that sounds a strangely peculiar idea, let me explain at once what I
  mean.


  I can dimly remember how, when I was a very little boy, my dear mother
  sometimes took me to a town where, if I remember rightly, about that time
  there was a change-over in the street-car system. The older type of street-car
  used to run on the battery system. There was an electric battery on the front
  or rear platform of the car, and so long as the battery was “alive” the car
  would run; but as soon as the battery was exhausted, the car would stop dead.
  It was far from satisfactory, hence the change-over.


  There are Christian believers who seem to run their spiritual life and service
  on that system. They go to a convention on the deeper life and when they
  return home, they are altogether different—for three weeks! Or they read some
  epochal Christian biography, and as they close the book they say, “Ah, life
  can never be the same again” nor is it—for three weeks! Or they have an
  all-night of prayer. Things have been going from bad to worse with them, so
  they bring things to a crisis. While others sleep, they wrestle on the banks
  of their nocturnal brook Jabbok (Genesis 23:22), and when the sun rises they
  are transfigured—for three weeks, after which they lapse again to the dull
  average. Why! Because they are resting on a crisis instead of on Christ.


  The Christian life was never meant to run on the battery system. It was meant
  to run on the electric circuit principle. You know what that is. Put simply,
  it is just this: continuous current through continuous contact. You and I have
  no power over the current; but we do have power over the contact; and when, by
  regular prayer-times, daily meditation in the written Word, consecration to
  Christ, and separation from unworthy ways, we maintain the “contact” then the
  heavenly current, the Holy Spirit, the life of Christ, is continuously
  communicated to us.
