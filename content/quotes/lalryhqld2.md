  God demands that we present ourselves—together with our families, business and
  wealth—wholly to Him. It seems, however, that every Christian tries to retain
  something for himself. Let us understand that although under the Old Covenant
  the people had to offer one-tenth to God, the New Covenant offering is
  ten-tenths.


  Many Christians are fearful lest God trouble them. Once a believer who was
  afraid of offering himself to the Lord said, "If I offer myself to God, and He
  makes me suffer, what can I do?" To which I replied quit seriously: "Who do
  you think God is? Suppose a child who used to disobey his parents said to them
  that hereafter he will obey them. Do you think his parents will deliberately
  require him to do what he cannot do so as to make him suffer? If so, they are
  not parents, but judges. Being parents, they doubtless will be especially
  merciful to their child. How, then, can you suggest that God would purposely
  cause you to suffer? Do you really think He would intentionally destroy you?
  You forget that He is your Father."


  Whoever is afraid to lay all (including people, things, and affairs) before
  God in consecration cannot be an overcomer... Consecration makes life powerful
  as well as joyful. He who is unwilling to offer to God is powerless, joyless,
  and sinful.
