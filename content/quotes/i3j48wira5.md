text: Looking unto Jesusâ€”and not at our faith. The last device of the adversary,
  when he cannot make us look elsewhere, is to turn our eyes from our Savior; to
  our faith; and thus to discourage us if it is weak, to fill us with pride if
  it is strong. Either way weakens us. For power does not come from the faith,
  but from the Savior by faith. It is not looking at our look, it is "Looking,
  looking unto Jesus!"
