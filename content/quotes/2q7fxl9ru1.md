  "Yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" This was
  Satan's crafty inquiry; and had the word of God been dwelling richly in Eve's

  and repel them by the word. To let them near the heart, for a moment, is to
  lose the only power by which to answer them.

  of God, and I am come to traduce him, and ruin you." This would not be

  God has spoken, is positive infidelity...
