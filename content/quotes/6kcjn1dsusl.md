  If you have been reasoned into Christianity, some wise fellow can reason you
  out of it! If you come to Christ by a flash of the Holy Spirit so that by
  intuition you know that you are God's child, you know it by the text but you
  also know it by the inner light, the inner illumination of the Spirit, and no
  one can ever reason you out of it.


  When I was a young man, I read most of the books on atheism. I had my Bible and a hymnbook and a few other books, including Andrew Murray and Thomas à Kempis, and I got myself educated as well as I could by reading books. I read the philosophy of all of the great minds—and many of those men did not believe in God, and they didn't believe in Christ...


  Do you know what I would do after I would read a chapter or two and find arguments that I could not possibly defeat? I would get down on my knees and with tears I would thank God with joy that no matter what the books said, "I know Thee, my Savior and my Lord!" I didn't have it in my head—I had it in my heart. There is a great difference, you see.
