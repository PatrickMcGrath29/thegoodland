  There was in England a man of God by the name of H.W. Webb-Peploe. Listen to
  what he testified:


  "I read the ninth verse, 'My grace is sufficient for thee'... I flung down my pen, threw myself on my knees, and said to God. 'It is not sufficient, it is not sufficient! Lord, let Thy grace be sufficient, O Lord, do!' ... As I opened my eyes I was saying, 'O God, let thy grace be sufficient for me,' and there on my wall I saw, My Grace Is Sufficient For Thee. The word is was in bright green, My was in black, and thee in black, 'MY grace is sufficient for THEE.' I heard a voice that seemed to say to me, 'You fool, how dare you ask God to make what is! Get up and take, and you will find it true. When God says 'is,' it is for you to believe Him, and you will find it true at every moment.' That is turned my life; from that moment I could say, 'O God whatever Thou dost say in Thy Word I believe, and please God, I will step out upon it."


  By believing the "I will" of the Lord Jesus, your problem is solved. Faith is not asking for what God has already promised. Faith is believing the promise of God.
