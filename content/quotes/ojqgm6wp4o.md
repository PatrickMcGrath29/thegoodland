  The preferring of the world before Christ himself. This is the height of
  covetousness, and the height of this adultery; what, to make the members of
  Christ the members of an harlot? Why, worldings! those admiring thoughts are
  Christ's, those pains are Christ's, that love is Christ's, that time, that
  care, that earnestness is Christ's; they are all Christ's, and will you give
  that which is Christ's unto the world? And prefer the world before Christ with
  his own? What, live as professed prostitutes, that prefer every one before
  their husbands?


  Christ is never precious in man's apprehension, so long as the world seems glorious to him. As we begin to relish sweetness in Christ, so the world begins to be bitter to us. The more sweetness we taste in the one, the more bitterness we taste in the other.
