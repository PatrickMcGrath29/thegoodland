  I think you will agree with me when I say that many people are confused about
  the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit, for instance, is not enthusiasm. Some
  people get enthusiasm, and they imagine it is the Holy Spirit. Some who can
  get all worked up over a song imagine that this is the Spirit, but this does
  not necessarily follow. Some of these same people go out and live just like
  the sinful world—but the Holy Spirit never enters a man and then lets him live
  just like the world that hates God. That is the reason most people don't want
  to be filled with the Holy Spirit—they want to live the way they want to live
  and to merely have the Holy Spirit as a bit of something extra.


  I tell you that the Holy Spirit will not be just an addition. The Holy Spirit must be Lord, or He will not come at all.
