  What is life? Life is more profound than thought; thought never surpasses
  life. It also is deeper than emotion; emotion is superficial in comparison
  with life. Whether thought or emotion, it is relatively external. What, then,
  is life? The Lord Jesus declared: "I am the life." 


  Life depends not on how enthusiastic is our emotion or on how manifold is our thought; it rests exclusively on whether the Lord has manifested His own self. There is therefore nothing more important than to know the Lord. As we are knowing Him, we are touching life. We ought to see before God the meaning of Christ our life (Colossians 3:4). If we know the Lord as our life, we realize the utter futility of all natural efforts in spiritual matters. Hence we look to Him alone.
