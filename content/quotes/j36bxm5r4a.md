  To write a sonnet to compare with those Shakespeare produced, you would have
  to have the spirit of Shakespeare... If you want to compose music like Johann
  Sebastian Bach, you would have to have the spirit of Bach. If you wanted to be
  a statesman like Gladstone, you would have to possess the spirit of Gladstone.
  Now, if we are going to reproduce Christ on earth and be Christ-like and show
  forth Christ, what are we going to need most? We must have the Spirit of
  Christ!


  The church is called to live above her own ability. She is called to live on a plane so high that no human being can live like that in his own ability and power. The humblest Christian is called to live a miracle, a life that is a moral and spiritual life with such intensity and such purity that no human being can do itâ€”only Jesus Christ can do it. He wants the Spirit of Christ to come to His people.
