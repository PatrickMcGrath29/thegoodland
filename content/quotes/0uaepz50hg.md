text: "We know that apart from the Lord we can do nothing, but we also know that
  if we do not go, the Lord does not work. The Lord's word is: \"Go and make
  disciples.\" The grammatical construction is that you and I ought to make
  disciples. This, you and I cannot do. It is the work of God. Yet, the Lord
  used a grammatical construction that seems to suggest that you and I are the
  operative people in making disciples. In other words, He was trying to tell
  us: \"I will do it in and through you. Go and make disciples; go and preach
  the gospel to every creature.\""
