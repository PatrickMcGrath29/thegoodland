  I found I had to accept His strength, through forgiveness and cleansing, for
  all my weakness. I had to recognize and acknowledge that in me (as well as in
  others whom I see around me) lies no good thing, apart from His indwelling
  presence. Only as I am daily willing for Him to crucify the self-life, the
  capital "I", can He live in and through me in His own triumphant, victorious
  life.


  So often I seem to have to learn lessons over and over again. Yet God is so graciously willing to go on teaching, so patiently waiting to fill and overflow with His daily enabling by His indwelling Holy Spirit.
