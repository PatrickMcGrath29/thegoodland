  First of all, please notice that victory is an exchange life, not a changed
  life. Victory is not that I have changed, but rather that I have been
  exchanged. One verse which is most familiar to us is Galatians 2:20: "I have
  been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth
  in me: and that life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith
  which is in the Son of God." What is meant by this verse? It has only one
  meaning: the life spoken of is an exchanged life. Basically, it is no longer
  I, for it has absolutely nothing to do with me. It is not that the bad I has
  become the good I, or the unclean I has changed to be the clean I. It is
  simply "not I." 


  "Change" is never God's way; His way is always "exchange." All these years I
  have not been able to change myself, yet God has exchanged me. This is
  holiness, this is perfection, this is victory, and this is the life of God's
  Son! Hallelujah! Henceforth the gentleness of Christ is my gentleness; the
  holiness of Christ is my holiness; the prayer life of Christ is my prayer
  life; the communion of Christ with God is now my communion with God. No sin is
  too big that I cannot overcome. No temptation is too severe that I cannot
  prevail. For the life that wins is Christ, not I. Will Christ ever be fearful
  of a big sin? Will He be afraid of a great temptation? Praise God, I no longer
  fear because hereafter it is Christ and not I.
