  Some people try to have faith in their own faith, instead of faith in Jesus
  Christ. They keep looking for a subjective condition. They ought to be looking
  to an objective Christ. True faith pays no attention whatever to itself. It
  centers all its gaze upon Christ.


  For faith is not our savior. Faith is simply an attitude of the soul through which Jesus saves. When Satan cannot beguile us in any other way, he gets us to scrutinizing our faith, instead of looking unto Christ. That Christian has the strongest heart who is the least conscious of its existence. And that faith is the strongest which pays no attention to itself.


  You may weaken the heart by centering your anxious attention upon it. So nothing will quicker weaken faith than the constant endeavor to discover it. It is like the child’s digging up of the seed to see if it is growing. It is a curiosity which brings disaster to the seed. It is not a man’s faith, but his faith in Christ which saves him. To be looking unto Christ is faith. To be looking unto anything else, even unto faith is a trouble to the soul.

  Therefore do not worry about your faith. Do not always be scanning it. Look away from it altogether—unto Jesus. For faith alone is naught. It is only faith in Jesus that counts. Take care that you are depending upon Jesus to save. And faith will take care of itself.
