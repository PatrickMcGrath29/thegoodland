text: Seek at the beginning to get my heart into such a state where it has no
  will of its own in regard to a given matter. Nine tenths of the difficulties
  are overcome when our hearts are ready to do the Lords will whatever it may
  be. Having done this I do not leave the result to feeling or simple
  impressions. If so, I make myself liable to great delusions. Then I seek the
  will of the Spirit of God through or in connection with the word of God. The
  Spirit and the word must be combined. If I look to the Spirit alone without
  the word I leave myself open to great delusions also. Next I take into account
  providential circumstances. These plainly indicate Gods will in connection
  with His word and Spirit. Then I ask God in prayer to reveal His will to me.
  Thus through prayer to God, the study of the word, and reflection I come to a
  deliberate judgement according to the best of my ability and knowledge. And if
  my mind is thus at peace and continues so after two or three petitions, I
  proceed accordingly.
