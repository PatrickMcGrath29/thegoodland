  I want to ask you, can believers live a holier life than is generally lived?
  Can believers experience the keeping power of God all the day, to keep them
  from sin? Can believers be kept in fellowship with God? And I bring you a
  message from the Word of God, in these words: "kept by the power of God" (1
  Peter 1:5). There is no qualifying clause to them. The meaning is, that if you
  will entrust yourself entirely and absolutely to the omnipotence of God, He
  will delight to keep you.


  I want to get that truth burned into my soul; I want to worship God until my whole heart is filled with the thought of His omnipotence. God is almighty, and the Almighty God offers Himself to work in my heart, to do the work of keeping me; and I want to get linked with Omnipotence, or rather, linked to the Omnipotent One, to the living God, and to have my place in the hollow of His hand.
