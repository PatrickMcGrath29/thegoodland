  A heart possessed of Christ is fortified against the most seductive
  allurements of the world... He being the sole object of their hearts, they are
  in the condition of soul to enter into, and enjoy, His beauties. They will
  detect His presence, the blessed fragrance of His words and His acts, where
  others will observe nothing. They live in His presence; they are wholly for
  Him; and hence it is the delight of Christ to disclose Himself to them in such
  attractive ways as to increase and elicit their affections towards Himself.


  It follows from what has been said that the state of our souls may be discerned by the effect produced upon us by the name of Jesus. If our hearts are careless and irresponsive when He is the subject of conversation or presentation, we cannot be in communion with the heart of God. Why even the name of a beloved object on earth will produce pleasurable emotions. How much more should the name of Christ, the object of God's heart — and also of ours if we know Him — awaken within us holy feelings of delight, which can only be expressed in praise and adoration!
