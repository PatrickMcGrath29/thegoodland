text: I believe we would have very much better converts if they were presented
  with a very much greater Christ. To anyone who does not know in their own life
  and experience salvation in Jesus Christ, what it really means to be born
  again - to be really a 'child of God', and TO KNOW IT - to be able to join in
  heartily with this apostle John when he said, 'Beloved, now are we the
  children of God... Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon
  us, that we should be called children of God, and such we are!' - to any such
  I would say this. While Jesus would be your Saviour, the Forgiver of your
  sins, and many other things to you, He is far, far greater than anything you
  can imagine. Salvation takes its greatness from the measure of the Saviour. If
  you want a great salvation, see what a great Saviour He is. And remember that
  because of what He is, you need have no fears in putting your trust in Him;
  you need not fear that you may not be able to 'keep it up'! No, you won't, but
  He will; He will be able to keep you up - He is great enough! We need an
  unveiling of the greatness of Jesus Christ, to get a better kind of Christian.
