text: I cannot believe that the Christ who lived for those thirty-three years on
  the earth and showed us the heart of God, can live happily in the midst of a
  company which remains absolutely unconcerned about the dying multitudes around
  it. I cannot believe that that Christ can live in my heart and my heart remain
  completely indifferent to the needs of dying men and woman around. This is not
  the Christ of God's word.
