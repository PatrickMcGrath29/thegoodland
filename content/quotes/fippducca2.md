  You and I are the body of Christ. He wants to express, if I may use it
  reverently, His personality through us. He wants to express His mind through
  us. He wants to express His heart through us. He wants somehow or other that
  other men and women might see through us the Lord Jesus Himself. Therefore, a
  very solemn responsibility rests upon us.


  Any church, any company which can only think of its own spiritual growth, its own glorious privileges, its future destiny and has forgotten that we are meant to be the vessel of God's salvation in this poor and dying world, is denying its very vocation. It is a caricature of a church. You cannot have the heart of Christ beating within a body and be altogether different in attitude and approach to Him.
