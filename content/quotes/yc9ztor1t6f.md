  We must be channels for the Word of God that Christ may speak through us and
  Christ may work through us by His Word. This means that we have got to have a
  knowledge of the Word of God. We must not only read God's Word and study God's
  Word; we must memorise God's Word.


  ... I know from my own experience, and the wickedness of my own heart, that some people trust more in their own words of persuasion and their own babbling than the Word of God. That is why some people can talk and talk and talk, they can corner people and hammer people, they can do all kinds of things, but nothing will ever happen. You can discuss, and discuss, and discuss, but it is only the Word of God that can get into a heart.
