  Many people know about God but don't know God Himself. There is a vast
  difference between knowing about God and knowing God—a vast difference! I can
  know about your relative—and still not know him in person. If I have never met
  him, I do not know the touch of his hand or the look of his eye or the smile
  of his face or the sound of his voice. I only know about him. You can show me
  his picture and describe him to me, but I still don't know him. I just know
  about the man. 


  So it is that the human being can know about God, can know about Christ's dying for him, can even write songs and books, can be the head of religious organizations and hold important church offices—and still never have come to the vital, personal knowledge of God at all. Only by the Holy Spirit can he know God.


  Again, it is my contention that as a consequence of this kind of error, we really have two Christs. We have the Christ of history, the Christ of the creeds. On the other hand, there is the Christ whom only the Spirit can reveal.
