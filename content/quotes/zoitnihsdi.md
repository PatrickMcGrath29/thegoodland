  To love the Lord my God with all my strength might, paradoxically, mean to
  love Him wholly in my weakness. By giving to Him what I thought of as my
  strength, realizing my actual weakness, He could then demonstrate His real
  strength.


  "My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9) took on new meaning.


  It was often far from pleasant, this learning process. I learned the frightening weakness of fear during the five months of rebel captivity, and it took an African brother, Basuana, to teach me to accept deliverance from fear by faith in the unshakeable Word of God. I learned that Christ could keep me calm and fill me with His peace, even while a storm of fear raged all around me.
