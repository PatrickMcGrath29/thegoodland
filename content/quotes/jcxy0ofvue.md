  But I have seen a fiery flame
  Take to his pure and burning heart
  Mere dust of earth, to it impart
  His virtue, till that dust became
  Transparent loveliness of flame.

  O Fire of God, Thou fervent Flame,
  Thy dust of earth in Thee would fall,
  And so be lost beyond recall,
  Transformed by Thee, its very name
  Forgotten in Thine own, O Flame.
