text: Miss M. E. Barber was a person in whom I found no trace of thought of
  remaining on earth for a long time. She was genuinely waiting for the Lord's
  return. Once I was walking with her on a street, and she said, "Perhaps, I
  will meet the Lord when we turn this corner." She asked me to walk at a
  distance from her on the other side of the sidewalk, and repeated, "I do not
  know whether this will be the corner for me." Those who wait for the Lord's
  return are like a man walking down a precipitous hill; he does not know for
  sure when he will turn a corner and meet someone walking up the same path. Our
  sister genuinely expected the Lord's return daily and hourly.
