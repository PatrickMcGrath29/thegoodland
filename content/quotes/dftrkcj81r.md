  For the recovery from our spiritual losses and declensions and failures, and
  deliverance from all these things which are so abhorrent to us and to Him,
  there is only one way, and that is, really to see His greatness. If we do
  that, we cannot live on a 'little' level. I recently went to the Planetarium
  in London. The thing that was with me, while listening to the lecture, and
  afterward, was, how ever can anyone be 'little' when they are dealing with
  these things all the time! I suppose it is possible even for a Fellow of the
  Astronomical Society to be a 'little' man in character (I am not implying this
  about this man, but it is possible!) but it is not possible to have a
  revelation of the greatness of Jesus Christ and remain a little person! Oh,
  for our enlargement, our ennoblement, our deliverance from our pettinesses,
  and all this which is so despicable! What is the answer? A new grasp of His
  greatness - that is all!


  And then, if we are suffering; if we are knowing adversity and trial; if the clouds seem to be gathering, and increasing, how will we get through? Only by getting away, and asking, seeking, pursuing in prayer a new heart revelation, a new unveiling, of Jesus Christ, and that will surely do it.
