text: "Is it an act, or a gradual process, this \"putting off the old man?\" It
  is both. It is a resolve taken once for all, but carried out in detail day by
  day. The first hour that the sap begins to withdraw, and the leaf-stalk begins
  to silt up, the leaf's fate is sealed: there is never a moment's reversal of
  the decision. Each day that follows is a steady carrying out of the plant's
  purpose: \"this old leaf shall die, and the new leaf shall live.\" So with
  your soul. Come to the decision once for all: \"every known sin shall go - if
  there is a deliverance to be had, I will have it.\" Put the Cross of Christ,
  in its mysterious delivering power, irrevocably between you and sinning, and
  hold on there. That is your part, and you must do it."
