  O how should all hearts be taken with this Christ! Christians, turn your eyes
  upon the Lord; "Look, and look again unto Jesus." Remember how he came out of
  his Father's bosom for thee, wept for thee, bled for thee, poured out his life
  for thee, is now risen for thee, gone to heaven for thee, sits at God's
  right-hand, and rules all the world for thee, makes intercession for thee, and
  at the end of the world will come again for thee, and receive thee to himself,
  to live with him forever and ever.


  Surely if thus thou believest, and livest, thy life is comfortable, and thy
  death will be sweet; if there be any heaven upon earth, thou wilt find it in
  the practice and exercise of this gospel duty, in "Looking unto Jesus."
