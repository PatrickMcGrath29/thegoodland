  "let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily
  entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us"
  (Hebrews 12:1b)


  Do you as a Christian really believe in Christ? Can you trust yourself
  absolutely and entirely into His hand? Dare you trust Him? Dare you trust in
  His promises? Or is there a streak of doubt and unbelief within you which
  insists upon arguing, “If I give up the world what will I have left? How can I
  go on if I give up to world?”

  Can you not believe that the Lord has something far better for you? Can you
  not believe He is able to deliver you from all your sin? Can you not put your
  trust in Him? If we truly desire to run the race we must lay aside the sin of
  unbelief and cast ourselves upon the Lord and trust Him.


  To lay aside sin, and especially the sin of unbelief, constitutes the first
  requirement which must be fulfilled if we would run after God in response to
  His love.


  But secondly, we must lay aside every weight which would heavily weigh us
  down. Weight may not necessarily be sin. Weight may be something legitimate,
  lawful, even respectable. Suppose I clothe myself with, among other things, a
  shirt, a tie, a coat, a heavy pair of shoes. This is respectable, this is
  quite legitimate, this is perfectly appropriate—if I am not running a race.
  But if I am running a race, then all these articles are quite unnecessary. Not
  only unnecessary, but they all become a burden to me! They weigh me down. They
  hinder me from running well. I have to strip myself to the uttermost, to the
  least necessaries, to the barest essentials. Then, I am free to run the race.


  With some people it may be sin, with so many others it is heavy weights. Oh,
  the cares of this life; the ease, the comfort, the luxury of it all. The many
  good things in this life. All which goes to make up the so-called affluent way
  of life. These elements may not be bad; they may in fact be very good and very
  respectful.


  But my dear brothers and sisters, if we desire them to such an extent that we
  must have them, if we desire them to such a degree that we cannot exist
  without them, to such a degree that they become a weight and a load upon us,
  then they hinder us from running fast; nay, they may hinder us from running at
  all! Our souls are not able to rise and ascend.
