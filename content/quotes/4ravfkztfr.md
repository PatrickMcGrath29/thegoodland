text: When the Spirit enters into the heart, He fills it entirely, so that the
  world finds no more room or place in it, because this Guest makes Himself sole
  Lord and Master of it. The first disciples and believers were so entirely
  taken possession of by this blissful dominion of the Pentecostal Spirit that
  they were no longer masters of their own tongues or any other member. They
  were compelled, as it were, to speak, even as the Spirit gave them utterance.
  They could not long speak according to their own judgment, knowledge, and
  learning. No! They were constrained to do and speak as the Holy Spirit would
  have them. Thus it is with every one with whom the Holy Spirit takes up His
  residence. He then experiences the blissful dominion of our Lord Jesus Christ
  in his heart. The Holy Spirit is then the scepter which is sent forth out of
  Zion into our hearts. He takes possession of all our will and desire, all our
  actions and deportment, all our inclinations and affections and makes us
  entirely subject to Him. He dwells in our hearts like a king in the realm of
  his palace. He ordains and accomplishes in us that which is pleasing and
  acceptable to Him. He creates in us another principle and beginning of life.
  He becomes to the soul, as it were, the life of her life. He renews her daily
  more and more in the image of Him that created her, and forms her into a
  temple of truth and righteousness—yea, to a living temple of God in Jesus
  Christ. All the glory of earthly kings and princes are only vain shadows and
  child’s-play compared with the single Pentecostal heart which is deemed worthy
  of receiving the Spirit of Jesus Christ in such plenitude.
