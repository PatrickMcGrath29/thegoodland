  I said: “Let me walk in the fields.” He said: “No, walk in the town.” I said:
  “There are no flowers there.” He said: “No flowers, but a crown.” 


  I said: “But the skies are black; There is nothing but noise and din.” And He wept as He sent me back – “There is more,” He said; “there is sin.” 


  I said: “But the air is thick, And fogs are veiling the sun.” He answered: “Yet souls are sick, and souls in the dark undone!” 


  I said: “I shall miss the light, and friends will miss me, they say.” He answered: “Choose tonight If I am to miss you or they.” 


  I pleaded for time to be given. He said: “Is it hard to decide? It will not seem so hard in heaven to have followed the steps of your Guide.” 


  I cast one look at the fields, Then set my face to the town; He said, “My child, do you yield? Will you leave the flowers for the crown?”


  Then into His hand went mine; And into my heart came He; And I walk in a light divine, the path I had feared to see.
