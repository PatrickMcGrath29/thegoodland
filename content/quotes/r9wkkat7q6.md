  There are four principles for Christians to follow by which they might be
  strengthened in their faith. The first principle is to read the Bible and
  meditate upon it. God becomes know to us through prayer and meditation upon
  His word. Secondly, seek to maintain an upright heart and a good conscience.
  The third principle is this, if you desire your faith to be strengthened you
  should not shrink from opportunities where your faith may be tried. Trials,
  obstacles, difficulties, and sometimes defeats are the very food of faith.
  Remember the beginning of anxiety is the end of faith, and the beginning of
  true faith is the end of anxiety. The last importance principle is to let God
  work for you. When the hour of trial comes do not work a deliverance of your
  own. The greater the difficulty to be overcome the more it will be seen to the
  glory of God how much can be done through prayer and faith.
