  Now, either to add to, or take from, God's Word, proves, very clearly, that
  His Word is not dwelling in my heart, or governing my conscience. If a man is
  finding his enjoyment in obedience, if it is his meat and his drink, if he is
  living by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Jehovah, he will,
  assuredly, be acquainted with, and fully alive to, His Word. He could not be
  indifferent to it. The Lord Jesus, in His conflict with Satan, accurately
  applied the Word, because He lived upon it, and esteemed it more than His
  necessary food. He could not misquote or misapply the Word, neither could He
  be indifferent about it. Not so Eve. She added to what God had said. His
  command was simple enough, "Thou shalt not eat of it." To this Eve adds her
  own words, "neither shall ye touch it." These were Eve's words and not God's.
  He had said nothing about touching; so that whether her misquotation proceeded
  from ignorance, or indifference, or a desire to represent God in an arbitrary
  light, or from all three together, it is plain that she was entirely off the
  true ground of simple confidence in, and subjection to, God's holy Word. "By
  the words of thy mouth, I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer."
