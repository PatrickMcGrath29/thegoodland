text: Now, either to add to, or take from, God's word, proves, very clearly,
  that his word is not dwelling in my heart, or governing my conscience. If a
  man is finding his enjoyment in obedience, if it is his meat and his drink, if
  he is living by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah, he
  will, assuredly, be acquainted with, and fully alive to, his word. He could
  not be indifferent to it. The Lord Jesus, in his conflict with Satan,
  accurately applied the word, because he lived upon it, and esteemed it more
  than his necessary food. He could not misquote or misapply the word, neither
  could he be indifferent about it. Not so Eve. She added to what God had said.
  His command[44] was simple enough, "Thou shalt not eat of it." To this Eve
  adds her own words, "neither shall ye touch it." These were Eve's words and
  not God's. He had said nothing about touching; so that whether her
  misquotation proceeded from ignorance, or indifference, or a desire to
  represent God in an arbitrary light, or from all three together, it is plain
  that she was entirely off the true ground of simple confidence in, and
  subjection to, God's holy word. "By the words of thy mouth, I have kept me
  from the paths of the destroyer."
