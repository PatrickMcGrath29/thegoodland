  If God leads you to walk a way that you know, it will not benefit you as much
  as if He would lead you to take the way that you do not know. This forces you
  to have hundreds and thousands of conversations with Him, resulting in a
  journey that is an everlasting memorial between you and Him.


  Your Leader will lead you to walk an untrodden way, to go down a path you never dreamed of. He is afraid of nothing, and He wishes you to be afraid of nothing also. He is with you. In desperate situations it is His joy to see His children grasping His hands.
