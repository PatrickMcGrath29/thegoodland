  Genuine faith believes in the Word of God exclusively, it is not believing in
  one's own experience, feeling, or dark environment. If environment and
  experience coincide with God's Word, we praise and thank the Lord. But if
  these disagree with His Word, then the Word of God alone stands true. Whatever
  is contrary to God's Word is false.


  One evening the Lord commanded His disciples to cross the Lake of Galilee to the other side. Suddenly there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat upon the boat so much that it was now filling up. The Lord Jesus was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. The disciples awakened Him and said, "Teacher carest Thou not that we perish?" The Lord arose and rebuked the wind. But what did He say to His disciples immediately afterwards? ... "have ye not faith?" (Mark 4:40). This indicates that many hasty prayers are but an expression of unbelief. If there were faith, you would stand firm. The Lord orders you to cross to the other side; He has not commanded you to go to the bottom of the lake. Because He has given His order—and no matter how strong the wind blows or how high the waves beat—the boat cannot capsize.


  Praise and thank God, victory is Christ, not I. Were it I, I could only endure so much, and then I would explode. But if it be Christ, no temptation will be too much for Him, nor any testing too difficult for Him. Stand on the side of God's word, stand on the side of faith—and Satan is rendered helpless. Since the Lord orders us to go to the other side, to the other side we will go. Not because our word counts, but because God's word is trustworthy, for He is forever faithful.


  No matter what the enemy says, your response is and always shall be that Christ is trustworthy and God's word is dependable. This is faith; this substantiates the truthfulness of God's Word...
