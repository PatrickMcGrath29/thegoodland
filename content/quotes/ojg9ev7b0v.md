text: "It is a great thing when a man comes to rest on God's almighty power for
  every moment of his life... Oh, let us say to God that we are going to prove
  Him to the very uttermost. Let us say: \"We ask thee for nothing more than
  Thou canst give, but we want nothing less.\" Let us say: \"My God, let my life
  be a proof of what the omnipotent God can do. Let these be the two
  dispositions of our souls every dayâ€”deep helplessness, and simple, childlike
  rest.\""
