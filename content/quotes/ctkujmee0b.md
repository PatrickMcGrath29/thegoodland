text: God has one great desire - to have what may be termed 'a people of His
  best'. Until He has such a people, He will never be wholly satisfied. There
  may be those who will accept His 'second-best' - for He surely often allows a
  second-best - but only a people set on His very best will truly satisfy His
  own heart. But since the attainment unto His best is a matter fraught with
  conflict and cost and discipline, and much that is utterly contrary to the
  whole course of nature, it is not everybody - indeed, it is but a comparative
  few - who will go on with Him to His best.
