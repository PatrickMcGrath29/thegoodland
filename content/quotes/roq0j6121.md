text: "I had known about Jesus Christ's dying for me, but I had never understood
  that if He had died for me, then I didn't belong to myself. Redemption means
  \"buying back\" so that if I belonged to Him, either I had to be a thief and
  keep what wasn't mine, or else I had to give up everything to God. When I came
  to see that Jesus Christ had died for me, it didn't seem hard to give up all
  to Him. It seemed just common, ordinary honesty. Then I read in the book [The
  Christian's Secret of a Happy Life]: \"When you have surrendered all to God,
  you have given Him all the responsibility, as well as everything else. It is
  God who is responsible to look after you and all you have to do is to trust.
  Put your hand in His and the Lord will lead you.\""
