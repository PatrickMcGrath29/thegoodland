text: "When you come to Christ, you must drop your conditions. You have to give
  up the right to say, ‘I will obey you if... I will do this if...' As soon as
  you say, ‘I will obey you if,’ that is not obedience at all. You are saying:
  ‘You are my adviser, not my Lord. I will be happy to take your
  recommendations. And I might even do some of them.’ No. If you want Jesus with
  you, you have to give up the right to self-determination. Self-denial is an
  act of rebellion against our late-modern culture of self-assertion. But that
  is what we are called to. Nothing less."
