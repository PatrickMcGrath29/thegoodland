text: The secret of Godâ€™s presence is actually believed by very few, but are you
  aware, that if each one truly believed it, the whole world would at once be
  filled with the saints, and the earth would be truly Paradise? If men really
  believed it as they should, they would need nothing more to induce them to
  give themselves up, heart and soul, to this loving God. But now it is hid from
  their eyes. Let us pray, my beloved, that God may be made known and manifested
  to many hearts, and thus in the light of His divine presence, the darkness of
  mere human life may be dispelled, and all things cast away, both without and
  within the heart, which hinder the growth and life of the soul, and which this
  light alone discovers and unveils. In all Christian practice there is nothing
  more universally needful, nothing simpler, sweeter, and more useful, nothing
  which so sums up in itself all Christian duties in one blessed act, as the
  realization of the loving presence of God.
