  "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold,
  your King is coming to you; He is just and having salvation, Lowly and riding
  on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9).


  "Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt
  tied, on which no one has ever sat. Loose it and bring it here. And if anyone
  asks you, ‘Why are you loosing it?’ thus you shall say to him, ‘Because the
  Lord has need of it.’" (Luke 19:30–31).


  By thus through the streets in state, Jesus Christ claimed to be a king... He
  rides to his capital; the streets of Jerusalem, the royal city, are open to
  him, like a king, he ascends to his palace. He was a spiritual king, and
  therefore he went not to the palace temporal but to the palace spiritual. He
  rides to the temple, and then, taking possession of it, he begins to teach in
  it as he had not done before. He had been sometimes in Solomon's porch, but he
  was oftener on the mountain's side than in the temple; but now, like a king,
  he takes possession of his palace, and there, sitting down on his prophetic
  throne, he teaches the people in his royal courts.


  Ye princes of the earth, give ear, there is one who claims to be numbered with
  you. It is Jesus, the Son of David, the King of the Jews. Room for him, ye
  emperors, room for him! Room for the man who was born in a manger! Room for
  the man whose disciples were fishermen! Room for him whose garment was that of
  a peasant, without seam, woven from the top throughout! He wears no crown
  except the crown of thorns, yet he is more royal than you. About his loins he
  wears no purple, yet he is more imperial far than you. Upon his feet there are
  no silver sandals bedight with pearls, yet he is more glorious than you. Room
  for him: room for him! Hosanna! Hosanna! Let him be proclaimed again a King! a
  King! a King! Let him value his place upon his throne, high above the kings of
  the earth.
