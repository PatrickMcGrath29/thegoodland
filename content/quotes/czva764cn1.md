text: There are large numbers of people in the Christian Church who seem to
  spend the whole of their life seeking something which they can never find,
  seeking for some kind of happiness and blessedness. They go around from
  meeting to meeting, and convention to convention, always hoping they are going
  to get this wonderful thing, this experience that is going to fill them with
  joy, and flood them with some ecstasy. They see that other people have had it,
  but they themselves do not seem to get itâ€¦ Now that is not surprising. We are
  not meant to hunger and thirst after experiences; we are not meant to hunger
  and thirst after blessedness. If we want to be truly happy and blessed we must
  hunger and thirst after righteousness. We must not put blessedness or
  happiness or experience in the first place.
