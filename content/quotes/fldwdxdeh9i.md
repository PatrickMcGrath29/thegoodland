text: What a simple thing it is to be a branch, the branch of a tree, or the
  branch of a vine! The branch grows out of the vine, or out of the tree, and
  there it lives and grows, and in due time, bears fruit. It has no
  responsibility except just to receive from the root and stem sap and
  nourishment. And if we only by the Holy Spirit knew our relationship to Jesus
  Christ, our work would be changed into the brightest and most heavenly thing
  upon earth. Instead of there ever being soul-weariness or exhaustion, our work
  would be like a new experience, linking us to Jesus as nothing else can. For,
  alas! is it not often true that our work comes between us and Jesus? What
  folly! The very work that He has to do in me, and I for Him, I take up in such
  a way that it separates me from Christ. Many a laborer in the vineyard has
  complained that he has too much work, and not time for close communion with
  Jesus, and that his usual work weakens his inclination for prayer, and that
  his too much intercourse with men darkens the spiritual life. Sad thought,
  that the bearing of fruit should separate the branch from the vine! That must
  be because we have looked upon our work as something other than the branch
  bearing fruit. May God deliver us from every false thought about the Christian
  life.
