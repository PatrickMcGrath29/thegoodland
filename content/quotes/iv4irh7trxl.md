text: God gives Christians the Holy Spirit with this intention, that every day
  all their life should be lived in the power of the Spirit. A man cannot live
  one hour a godly life unless by the power of the Holy Ghost. He may live a
  proper, consistent life, as people call it, an irreproachable life, a life of
  virtue and diligent service; but to live a life acceptable to God, in the
  enjoyment of God's salvation and God's love, to live and walk in the power of
  the new lifeâ€”he cannot do it unless he be guided by the Holy Spirit every day
  and every hour.
