text: I once saw a picture of the Constitution of the United States, very
  skillfully engraved in copper plate, so that when you looked at it closely it
  was nothing more than a piece of writing, but when you looked at it at a
  distance, it was the face of George Washington. The face shone out in the
  shading of the letters at a little distance, and I saw the person, not the
  words, nor the ideas; and I thought, “‘That is the way to look at the
  Scriptures and understand the thoughts of God, to see in them the face of
  love, shining through and through; not ideas, nor doctrines, but Jesus Himself
  as the Life and Source and sustaining Presence of all our life.”
