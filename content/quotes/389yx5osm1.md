  How does the Lord ever meet a great need? What is that which alone will supply
  the need, and be the key to the problem, the answer to the demand, and the
  assured ground, both of recovery and renewal, and of fortification for the
  suffering? And the answer has ever been, and always is: A new revelation - an
  unveiling - of the greatness of Jesus Christ. That is the very platform, we
  might say, upon which and from which the Lord moves into these situations, and
  into all the situations that follow in this book. He prefaces everything with
  this fresh revelation or unveiling of His own personal greatness.


  But oh, these are but words! When we have said these things - and we would all agree that they are true - we are still so helpless, because it is the THING that matters - not talking about it! If only, by the Holy Spirit - and there is no other way, no other means - we could catch a new glimpse of His greatness, how many problems that would solve, questions that would answer, needs that would meet! How OVERWHELMING it would be! - and when I say 'overwhelming', I mean, how much would be overwhelmed! A mighty tidal wave, making all these rocks, upon which we threaten to founder, as nothing; they are sunk beneath it, disappear from view.
