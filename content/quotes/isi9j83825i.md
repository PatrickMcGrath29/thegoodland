text: The anointing of the Holy Spirit helps me greatly when I preach. I would
  never attempt to teach the truth of God by my own power. One day before
  preaching at Teignmouth, I had more time than usual, so I prayed and meditated
  for six hours in preparation for the evening meeting. After I had spoken a
  little while, I felt that I was speaking in my own strength rather than God's
  power. I told the brethren that I felt as though I was not preaching under the
  anointing and asked them to pray. After I continued a little longer, I felt
  the same and therefore ended my sermon and proposed that we have a meeting for
  prayer. We did so, and I was particularly assisted by the Holy Spirit the next
  time I preached. I am glad that I learned the importance of ministering in
  God's power alone. I can do all things through Christ, but without Him, I can
  accomplish nothing.
