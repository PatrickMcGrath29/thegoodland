text: It is a matter of astonishment, adoration, and delight, to see how the
  Lord can induce us to let every thing go. Everything appears so frivolous,
  unsatisfying, trifling, and superficial-even good and spiritual things which
  formerly afforded such gratification, and of which we were so tenacious, but
  which, for that very reason, served only to interpose between us and God, and
  were injurious, because they were held so fast. Jesus alone is sufficient, but
  yet insufficient, when He is not wholly and solely embraced.
