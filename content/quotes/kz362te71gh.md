  “Teach me Thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path...” (Psalm 27:11).


  God only is holy; He alone knows how to lead His children in the paths of holiness.  He knows every aspect of your soul, every thought of your heart, every secret of your character, its difficulties and hindrances.  He knows how to mold you to His will and lead you onwards to perfect sanctification.


  The consequences of this belief, if fully grasped, will influence your whole life.  You will seek to give yourself up to God more and more unreservedly, asking nothing, refusing nothing, wishing nothing but what He wills; not seeking to bring things about for yourself, taking all He sends joyfully and believing the “one step” set before you to be enough for you.
