text: God had spiritual victory as His thought when He first forgave us our
  sins, and in His mind this is to be the normal development of every
  Christian's life. Every movement forward, however, is related to the cross,
  and there is a sense in which there is not one step forward in the spiritual
  life which is not preceded by a step backward. What I mean is this, that there
  has to be some undoing before there can be any upbuilding. The Christ who is
  the power of God to us is the crucified Christ who progressively applies the
  cross to us also, so that being released from the flesh which so holds us
  back, we may advance in the realm of the Spirit. So spiritual progress is not
  conditioned by special teaching but by ever deeper experiences of the
  in-working of the cross of Christ.
