text: There is nothing more tragic than to come to the end of life and know we
  have been on the wrong course. We have only one life to live down here and we
  are free to do as we please with it, but if we seek our own pleasure our life
  will never glorify God. A devoted Christian once said in my hearing, ‘I want
  nothing for myself; I want everything for God.’ Do you want anything apart
  from God, or does all your desire center in His will? Can you truly say that
  the will of God is “good and acceptable and perfect” to you? (Romans 12:2)
