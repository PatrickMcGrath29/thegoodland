text: "Looking unto Jesus—to go forth from\_ourselves\_and to forget ourselves—so that our darkness may flee away before the brightness of His face; so that our joys may be holy, and our sorrow restrained; that He may cast us down, and that He may raise us up; that He may afflict us, and that He may comfort us; that He may despoil us, and that He may enrich us; that He may teach us to pray, and that He may answer our prayers; that while leaving us\_in\_the world, He may separate us\_from\_it, our life being hidden with Him in God, and our behavior bearing witness to Him before men."
