text: To be a living sacrifice will involve all my time. God wants me to live
  every minute for Him in accordance with His will and purpose, sixty minutes of
  every hour, twenty-four hours of every day, being available to Him. No time
  can be considered as my own, or as "off-duty" or "free." I cannot barter with
  God about how much time I can give to serve Him. Whatever I am doing, be it a
  routine salaried job, or housework at home, be it holiday time and free, or
  after-work Christian youth activities, all should be undertaken for Him, to
  reveal His indwelling presence to those around me. The example of my life must
  be as telling as my preaching if He is to be honored.
