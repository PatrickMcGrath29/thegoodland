  We want our lives kept, not that we may feel happy, and be saved the distress
  consequent on wandering, and get the power with God and man, and all the other
  privileges linked with it. We shall have all this, because the lower is
  included in the higher: but our true aim, if the love of Christ constraineth
  us, will be far beyond this.


  Not for 'me' at all but 'for Jesus'; not for my safety, but for His glory; not for my comfort, but for His joy; not that I may find rest, but that He may see the travail of His soul, and be satisfied! Yes, for Him I want to be kept. Kept for His sake; kept for His use; kept to be His witness; kept for His joy! Kept for Him, that in me He may show forth some tiny sparkle of His light and beauty; kept to do His will and His work in His own way; kept, it may be, to suffer for His sake; kept for Him, that He may do just what seemeth Him good with me; kept, so that no other lord shall have any more dominion over me, but that Jesus shall have all there is to have;—little enough, indeed, but not divided or diminished by any other claim. Is not this, O you who love the Lord—is not this worth living for, worth asking for, worth trusting for?


  This is consecration, and I cannot tell you the blessedness of it.
