text: "\"We do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which
  are not seen,\" said Paul (2 Corinthians 4:18). A Christian's aim is beyond
  visible things. O when a soul comes to know what an eternal God is, and what
  an eternal Jesus is, and what an eternal crown is; when it knows that great
  design of Christ to save poor souls, and to communicate himself eternally to
  such poor creatures, this takes off the edge of its desires as to visible
  temporal things; what are they in comparison?"
