  Christendom is full of solemn warnings as to the tendency of our hearts to
  drop into a routine of religious forms. It is a very great loss to the soul to
  get into the habit of repeating substantially the same words in prayer every
  day. It is not real prayer at all.


  We read, “In everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your
  requests be made known unto God.” How can you do that if you are using the
  same form of words day after day, and week after week? Today is not like
  yesterday, and tomorrow will not be like today. If you are really with God you
  will be sensitive to the fresh needs of every day.


  God delights to have our confidence as to every need and care. Then let us
  cultivate a child’s confidence, and a child’s simplicity as we come to Him in
  prayer. Bring the trying circumstances of today, and the expected difficulties
  and perplexities of tomorrow to the blessed God who tells you to cast all your
  care upon Him, for He careth for you. Be simple: give up the long preface; do
  not feel it necessary to quote a dozen scriptures; ask as a needy and
  confiding child would ask its parent.
