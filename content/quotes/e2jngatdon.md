  Having found the people and testified to them, we introduce them to Christ.
  This is absolutely vital. We must ask the Lord to be doing an ever deeper work
  in us, so that we have a living, present-day experience of the Lord Jesus, and
  we are in a position where we are able to introduce someone to Christ. This is
  the whole point. It is just this that is so vital. To find people and speak to
  them some words about Christ is wonderful, and it is right; but if we leave it
  there, and cannot actually introduce them to the living, risen Christ, we have
  failed.


  ... You are simply introducing people to Christ. He will do the work, praise God! His is the finished work. He will convict. He will draw. He will save. The great thing is for you to be an open, cleansed channel so that you can be the one who links the risen Christ with a needy, sinful soul.
