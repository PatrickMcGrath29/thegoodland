text: If your Lord calls you to suffering, do not be dismayed, for He will
  provide a deeper portion of Christ in your suffering. The softest pillow will
  be placed under your head though you must set your bare feet among thorns. Do
  not be afraid at suffering for Christ, for He has a sweet peace for a
  sufferer. God has called you to Christ's side, and if the wind is now in His
  face, you cannot expect to rest on the sheltered side of the hill. You cannot
  be above your Master who received many an innocent stroke. The greatest
  temptation out of hell is to live without trials. A pool of standing water
  will turn stagnant. Faith grows more with the sharp winter storm in its face.
  Grace withers without adversity. You cannot sneak quietly into heaven without
  a cross. Crosses form us into His image. They cut away the pieces of our
  corruption. Lord cut, carve, wound; Lord do anything to perfect Your image in
  us and make us fit for glory! We need winnowing before we enter the kingdom of
  God. O what I owe to the file, hammer, and furnace! Why should I be surprised
  at the plough that makes such deep furrows in my soul? Whatever direction the
  wind blows, it will blow us to the Lord. His hand will direct us safely to the
  heavenly shore to find the weight of eternal glory. As we look back to our
  pains and suffering, we shall see that suffering is not worthy to be compared
  to our first night's welcome home in heaven. If we could smell of heaven and
  our country above, our crosses would not bite us. Lay all your loads by faith
  on Christ, ease yourself, and let Him bear all. He can, He does, and He will
  bear you. Whether God comes with a rod or a crown, He comes with Himself.
  "Have courage, I am your salvation!" Welcome, welcome Jesus!
