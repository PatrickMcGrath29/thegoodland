text: Brethren, here is the path to the higher life. Down, lower down! This was
  what Jesus ever said to the disciples who were thinking of being great in the
  kingdom, and of sitting on His right hand and His left. Seek not, ask not for
  exaltation; that is God's work. Look to it that you abase and humble
  yourselves, and take no place before God or man but that of servant; that is
  your work; let that be your one purpose and prayer. God is faithful. Just as
  water ever seeks and fills the lowest place, so the moment God finds the
  creature abased and empty, His glory and power flow in to exalt and to bless.
  He that humbles himself-that must be our one care shall be exalted; that is
  God's care; by His mighty power and in His great love He will do it.
