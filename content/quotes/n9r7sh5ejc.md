  The Scriptures show us that Christ is our head (Eph 1:22, 4:15, Col 1:18).
  Just as the head of a man feels and cares for and controls the body, so Christ
  is towards us who are Christians. We do not need to ask Him to be our head
  that we may be His body. Today He is the head, and we are members of His
  body... God's Word states that Christ is the head; do you believe that He is
  at present caring for you?


  The Word of God also reveals to us that Christ is the vine and we are the branches (John 15:5). It is not that He will become our vine and we will become His branches. It is not that in the near future when our spiritual life is more advanced than it is now we will then become His branches and He will become our vine. We should bear fruit as He does. We should be filled with virtues as He is filled with virtues. For He has given His "sap"—that is to say, His life and fruit-producing power—to us. He is now already the trunk, and we are already His branches. He is presently supplying to us His life with His perfection and holiness and all virtues. Do we believe this? Do we believe that He now is our trunk and we are His branches?


  When you believed Him as your Savior, you were already perfectly joined to Him. Do you believe this? You do not need to figure out how you can be joined to Him since God has already made you and Him into one tree. Can you now believe that He shall be towards you even as the physical trunk of a tree is towards its branches? It is not that you bear fruit for Him, but rather that He bears fruit through you.


  The grace of God has already given the Lord Jesus to us; today by faith we accept all that God has given us so that the life, power, liberty, and holiness of Christ may be manifested in our body.


  By believing what God says about Christ dying on the cross for us, we receive eternal life. Likewise, by believing that the Lord Jesus lives in us, we receive the life that wins.
