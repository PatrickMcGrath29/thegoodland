  "Keep my moments and my days, let them flow in ceaseless praise"


  Is it too much for them all to 'flow in ceaseless praise'? Well, where will you stop? What proportion of your moments do you think enough for Jesus? How many for the spirit of praise, and how many for the spirit of heaviness? Be explicit about it, and come to an understanding. If He is not to have all, then how much? Calculate, balance, and apportion. You will not be able to do this in heaven—you know it will be all praise there; but you are free to halve your service of praise here, or to make the proportion what you will.


  Yet,—He made you for His glory.

  Yet,—He chose you that you should be to the praise of His glory.

  Yet,—He loves you every moment, waters you every moment, watches you unslumberingly, cares for you unceasingly.

  Yet,—He died for you!


  Dear friends, one can hardly write it without tears. Shall you or I remember all this love, and hesitate to give all our moments up to Him? Let us entrust Him with them, and ask Him to keep them all, every single one, for His own beloved self, and fill them all with His praise, and let them all be to His praise!
