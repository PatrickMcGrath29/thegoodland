Soul, art thou really waiting\
"Expecting to receive?"\
The fulness of His faithful Word\
Dost thou indeed believe?

When in the morning stillness\
Thou bendest low in prayer,\
Is it indeed *expecting*\
To meet thy Saviour there?

As each petition rises\
Is it breathed forth in faith,\
That he who fully trusteth\
"Shall have whate'er he saith?"

Thy soul has asked His keeping,\
But in temptation's hour\
Dost thou stand still *expecting*\
To prove His mighty power.

Thou fain would'st die with Jesus,\
And in His Word hast read\
That, in the death He suffered\
His children too "are dead."

Thy soul hath claimed its union\
With Him, thy gracious Lord,\
But art thou *now* "expecting"\
To prove His faithful word?

Oft hast thou yearned to know it,\
That Pentecostal Fire,\
And with thy God hast pleaded\
With deep and strong desire.

The while His promise standeth\
Eternally the same,\
"How much more shall your Father\
Give the Spirit" in His name.

With thy petitions mingled\
Is there triumphant faith\
That here and now accepteth\
Whate'er thy Father saith?

Thou *askest*, but the blessing\
Is scantily outpoured,\
Thou art not really waiting\
An answer from thy Lord.

And so the soul is hungry\
That yet He waits to fill,\
And restless is the spirit\
The peace of God would still.

Oh, learn the simple lesson\
To childlike spirits taught,\
Thy Lord's desire to bless thee\
Transcends all speech or thought,

Henceforth be thine this keynote,\
"Expecting to receive,"\
And hear His gracious answer,\
“*All* things... if thou believe.”
