> **"Shepherd the flock of God among you..."**\
> — 1 Peter 5:2 

There is a ministry of shepherding that the Lord calls us into. The Lord is our Shepherd, and He calls us to likewise shepherd one another. We must take this seriously, if we are to love what the Lord loves and be obedient to His call for us. We must draw near to God's heart to seek "what" we ought to do, "how" we ought to do it, as well as the "why" behind it. 

How can we Shepherd?

To be a disciple is to be taught, disciplined, transformed, molded, and led by the Lord. Look upon the Shepherd, learn from His nature, learn from His ways and be gentle as He is. See the manner in which Jesus related to people while He was on the earth: “And having seen the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and helpless, as sheep not having a shepherd” (Matthew 9:36) 

Let us examine His Word, as to how we ought to relate to one another and shepherd one another: 

“As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace” (1 Peter 4:10). “Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others” (Philippians 2:4), for “none of us lives to himself alone” (Romans 14:7). “Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ” (Galatians 6:2), “encouraging one another and building one another up” (1 Thessalonians 5:11). “Admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all” (1 Thessalonians 5:14). “If anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness” (Galatians 6:1),  remembering that “faithful are the wounds of a friend” (Proverbs 27:6), and “Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another” (Proverbs 27:17).

“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom” (Colossians 3:16), and “speak the truth in love, growing up in every way into Him who is the head, into Christ” (Ephesians 4:15). “Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another” (1 Peter 5:5), “for God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” “Put on, then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience” (Colossians 3:12), “for love covers a multitude of sins” (1 Peter 4:8). “Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God” (Hebrews 13:16). And remember the words of our Lord: “Truly I say to you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of Mine, you did for Me” (Matthew 25:40).

Praise the Lord - He has given us much wisdom, through His Word, on how we ought to relate to one another, care for one another, honor one another, Shepherd one another, and love one another.

**A Shepherd Must Know The Condition of the Flock**

"Be diligent to know the state of your flocks, and attend to your herds" Proverbs 27:23. Diligence requires intentionality, perseverance, and vision. What are the needs of the brothers and the sisters around you? Do you care to cultivate an intentional awareness of the Lord's needs, and therefore His body's needs? 

Let Christ in you serve others. Let yourself be served by Christ first, receiving from Him first. Then, with the same diligence and rest that led Mary to sit at Jesus’ feet and to stay there, you too shall receive from and overflow with the Christ in You that pours out into the lives of others. 

**What is the Goal? Shepherding as a function for the edification of the Church** 

To love the Lord is to love His body; if we care about the Head and the needs of the Lord, we must care about the body, and the need of His saints. We need to know the spiritual condition of each other to be able to adequately provide according to the needs. 

Ephesians 4:12-16 "for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we should no longer be children..." {but, instead} "...may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ— from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.

This is the profound bigger picture that God wants to enter us into.
