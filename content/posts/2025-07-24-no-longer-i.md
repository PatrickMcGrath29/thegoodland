"No longer I, but Christ." O precious Lord,\
How shall I speak the sweetness of this word,\
By which from bondage Thou hast set me free,\
Giving me perfect liberty in Thee.\
"No longer I, but Christ"—then am I "dead,"\
"Buried," yet risen in my glorious Head;\
"Buried," that self no longer come between\
His love and souls. Henceforth be only seen\
The beauty and the glory of my Lord\
Upon His child: His power in every word,\
His love in every act, and look and tone,\
Mine the sweet peace, the glory His alone.\
"No longer I," when comes temptation’s hour,\
His is the kingdom, therefore His the power;\
He knoweth how to keep in perfect peace\
The soul in which His reign doth never cease.\
"No longer I, but Christ,"—I may not choose\
But follow each command, nor e’er refuse\
A call to service whatsoe’er it be,\
For Jesus calls and is enough for me.\
O life of sweetest liberty so blest,\
I yield Him all, and He does all the rest.
