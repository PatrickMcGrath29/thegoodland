Mid the restless, ceaseless changes\
  Of all life below,\
One there is "abideth ever,"\
  Who no change can know.\
Oh, the holy calm and gladness\
  Of the souls that rest\
On "the Everlasting Father,"\
  And in Him are blest.

"Everlasting love" has sought them,\
  When in sin astray,\
"Everlasting love" shines o’er them,\
  Brightening all their way.\
Can they doubt that love so changeless\
  Orders each event,\
E’en that dark, mysterious trials\
  Are in mercy sent?

"Everlasting" their "salvation",\
  For His words declare\
That His own "shall never perish,"\
  That His life they share.\
Through the "Everlasting convenant"\
  Full assurance given,\
That, through one accepted Offering,\
  All is now forgiven.

Deathless walk they ’mid the dying\
  In a world undone,\
"Everlasting life" their portion,\
  Heaven on earth begun.\
Theirs no vague, uncertain hoping\
  Future life to gain,\
But a present, glad assurance,\
  Which will ne’er prove vain.

Knowing thus His life eternal,\
  Can they but rejoice?\
"Everlasting joy" up-springing,\
  Tuning heart and voice.\
Joy that never took its rising\
  From an earthly well,\
Joy so deep words fail to utter\
  All the heart would tell.

And a calm, sweet rest is o’er them,\
  Life is freed from care,\
"Everlasting arms" are ’neath them\
  Ever to upbear.\
They are loosed from selfish burdens,\
  Other’s loads to share,\
Pointing toilers to the Saviour,\
  Who their sin did bear.

"Everlasting light" shines on them,\
  Forth that light they give,\
God, their everlasting glory,\
  And in Him they live.

Hath thy life this sure foundation\
  Laid in Heaven above?\
Then no change, no storm thine anchor\
  Ever shall remove.
