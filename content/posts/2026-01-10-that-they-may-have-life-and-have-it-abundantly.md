**“I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly”**

#### I. The mission of the Good Shepherd, in our Lord’s words, in relation to the divine life

> “I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly”\
> — (John 10:10)

Every time that we have a conference, I’m always so encouraged that even in these “last days,” in a difficult and confusing and late hour, our God is still speaking to us. And I’m also reminded of what our Father said regarding the Lord Jesus when He was baptized: “This is My beloved Son…Listen to Him!” (Matt 17:5). And so yes, Lord, as we have had the opportunity to gather together at this conference as Your people, and listen to what You are saying in this time and for the upcoming season, we do want to continue to have an ear that is listening carefully, and also a heart that is diligent to take the “more earnest heed to the things that we have heard, lest we drift away from them” (Heb 2:1). Lord, we thank You for the opportunity to meditate more on these matters, and we are looking forward to experiencing Your shepherding of us into the truth of these things in the coming year!

At this year’s Harvey Cedars conference, the theme focused our attention on our Lord as the Great Shepherd, our Chief Shepherd, and our calling as His flock.

We were reminded that before we can shepherd others, we need to know what we are shepherding people unto – and specifically, as under-shepherds to our Chief Shepherd, what the heart and purpose of our Good Shepherd is. If we are not completely clear on this matter, we could expend a great deal of heart energy, zeal, and time shepherding, and yet completely miss the mark – and even more concerningly, we could be leading other sheep completely away from what our Lord Jesus is truly after. 

I so appreciate that through the Word of God, we can directly hear from our own Lord’s mouth directly what is in His heart – and our Lord Himself spoke directly in John 10 about His mission and role as the Good Shepherd. He sums up His mission in John 10:10, “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; ***I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.***” His purpose as the Good Shepherd – after bringing His sheep into His fold, to become His flock – is to lead them into ***life.*** And not just a life that is barely surviving, or just born, but ***abundant life.***

We thank the Lord, He did not save us to bring us into a doctrine, or teaching, or religion, or group of people, or a manner of meeting, or a pattern of existence, or a collection of laws. He did not come to just shepherd us into submission, or domineer over us like so many charismatic figures in history, or to gain a group of automatons that simply are forced to obey and act in certain ways – but He comes as the Good Shepherd, to bring us as lambs and children of God into the divine life. That we might be born again anew with this divine life through Him, but more than just the new birth. As He says in John 10:9 – “I am the Door; anyone who enters through Me will be saved” – but He immediately follows that up with John 10:10 “I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.” 

He has come to give us the divine life – His own life (John 14:6) – but then to lead us daily, continually, forever into that ***experience*** of the divine life and an ever-growing, living knowledge of Him. (John 17:3 “And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, Whom You have sent.”) Lord, we thank You that it is *Your* own work to lead us into this life, and we want to respond and say that we do want to submit to Your leading so that we can experience more of this life every day! 

#### II. His shepherding leads us into the abundant life

> *“He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me by the still waters”*\
> — Psalm 23

During the conference, we were reminded of examples of the non-abundant life - such as the children of Israel in the wilderness. They were called to be the chosen flock of God with a heavenly calling. And yet their life was very sad when we look at it, in terms of falling short of God’s great calling for their life. They were harassed by the nations of the world around them, fighting among each other, bitter in heart toward God, wrongly accusing God of wanting to kill and hurt them, complaining constantly, struggling through the difficult wilderness, attacking their leaders, and confused and lost about the purpose of their life and even existence. Their following was an outward one – physically, but not in heart – and their human shepherd was a faithful, but earthly one as well in figure – Moses. Moses could provide them doctrines and teachings from God, but he (despite his faithfulness and patience and own experience of God) could not provide them the supernatural, divine life needed to be able to follow their true Shepherd and enter into that for which God had saved them. Without this heavenly life in them, there was no way for them to be able to enter fully into their heavenly calling. 

We are encouraged however that today we live in a new dispensation, in which our Lord Jesus has laid down His life on earth for us, that we might receive and live by His heavenly life today. We are also encouraged by the books of Hebrews and 1 Peter, that our Lord is continuing to minister toward us today - as our Great High Priest and the great Shepherd of the sheep (Heb 13:20), and as the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls (1 Peter 2:25). His ministry, and the work of the Holy Spirit, is to lead us into this experience of His life today.

In Psalm 23, one of the most well-known passages about shepherding, we see a picture of our Lord’s shepherding leading us into life:

1. *“He makes me lie down”* – experiencing His rest which restores and rejuvenates life 
2. *“In green pastures”* – not wandering confused and starving, and not in dry pastures, or pastures of poison that lead to death, or pastures of weeds that lead to illness and weakness – He leads us to feed on the living bread in abundance, so that this divine life in us grows, so that we can enjoy His goodness, and so that we have strength to keep walking this heavenly way
3. *“He leads me”* – He brings us in this “narrow way which leads to life” (Matt 7:13-14), and He leads us Himself in His gentleness and love
4. *“Beside quiet waters”* – sometimes there are rushing waters that seem too difficult for us (like the tired Samaritan woman said in John 4: “the well is deep”), and in our thirst we become discouraged and afraid and tired, but our Good Shepherd knows where we can safely drink, what is accessible for us, what we need in the moment to refresh our spirit, soul and body. He is our living water (John 4), and as we drink of Him, we are not only made alive, but we are satisfied by this abundant life. 

#### III. This abundant life transforms us, and draws us to want to have part with our Shepherd, and take on His shepherding heart

> *“Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where do you pasture your flock?”*\
> — Song of Songs 1:7

We were reminded during the conference that the analogy of the sheep and shepherd is limited in its earthly form, in that our Lord is looking for more than just sheep that follow Him. While sheep can only at most physically follow a shepherd, our Lord is looking for a flock that is not only following Him outwardly, but inwardly transformed into His nature in character and life – a people and a Bride as well, that in this life, also desire to respond to His heart and share in His purpose and work. 

As the Lord sought to draw out Peter in John 21 (“Do you love Me?...Tend my sheep”) to translate his love for his Lord into an actionable love for what His Lord loved – it seems that the natural response of letting this abundant life take hold of us and transform us is for our heart to be transformed into a shepherding heart.

In Song of Songs 1:7-8, we see this illustrated in the picture of the Bride, who is just starting to glimpse something of the beauty and wonderfulness of her Bridegroom. She has been caught by a vision of one who now “her soul loves,” and her corresponding heart response is to call out to her Bridegroom to ask: “Where do you pasture your flock? Where do you make it lie down at noon?” 

As those who are drawn by the Lord as well, perhaps we have also caught something of the heart response of this Bride and echo her desire to launch out in response. But we also often do not know where to start in this shepherding journey. Lord, we do pray that You would also give us this simple heart of the Bride that we could simply inquire of You as our Bridegroom and Shepherd to show us Your ways. Many times we may feel that even the small number of “young goats” (1:8) we have is beyond us, and we are lost in terms of where or how to find spiritual food to feed them, and how to get them to the green pastures. But we thank the Lord as well for His direct response and encouragement to us, to follow in the “tracks of His flock” that we can see in His own example leading His flock, His Word with the cloud of witnesses and under-shepherds in it, and His Body on earth today with faithful servants following after their Shepherd and encouraging us in their example as well.

#### IV. Our role as a shepherd is to bring sheep to the Source of all Life, our Chief Shepherd

> *“In Christ, God was reconciling the world to Himself…Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, God making His appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God”*\
> — 2 Cor 5:18-20

> *“For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls”*\
> — 1 Pet 2:25

We were also encouraged at the conference that the role of our shepherding is to bring people to the Source of this Life, our Lord Jesus. So as we serve in His flock and house, may the Holy Spirit give us wisdom – in our times of fellowship, worship, encouragement, sharing, individual meetings, counseling – that we are bringing hungry hearts into an experience of His life. That we are not just focusing on giving answers to questions, or conforming people to a way of living or meeting, or increasing their Biblical or doctrinal knowledge – but that first and foremost, we are helping bring them into an encounter with the living God – to hear His gentle voice, to see His goodness, to touch a bit of His greatness, to be freed in His presence, to be healed by His love. May we be simply introducers between tired or lost or thirsty or hurt sheep to our wonderful, abundant, all-powerful Shepherd. 

Lord, we thank You that You came to give us life, and give it abundantly. And so Lord, as we do desire to enter into Your heart and burden, and to be transformed by Your life into shepherds after Your heart – we do look to Your Holy Spirit to show us how to lead those You have entrusted to us to meet the You, as the Living One. We are so small and inadequate and know so little, but we do know that You are the answer to all of our questions, and all of the sheep’s questions and needs, and it is Your life that quickens and can save. We thank You for so great a salvation, and so abundant a life, and we do desire that we all as Your people and the sheep of Your pasture, might day by day, and moment by moment continually experience the freshness and transforming power of Your life, such that Your will is accomplished in Your people. Amen.
