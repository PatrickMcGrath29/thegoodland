title: The Appearing of Jesus Christ
summary: Jesus Christ’s first appearing two thousand years ago brought about the
  end of death and the beginning of life and immortality, for all who put their
  trust in Him. In His final appearing, He will bring about an end to sin and to
  pain, and all things will be made new. In between these two points in time
  though, He still desires to appear to us who love and obey Him.

<blockquote>"​​But has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel."<footer>2 Timothy 1:10</footer></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.”<footer>2 Timothy 4:8</footer></blockquote>

Jesus Christ’s first appearing two thousand years ago brought about the end of death and the beginning of life and immortality, for all who put their trust in Him. In His final appearing, He will bring about an end to sin and to pain, and all things will be made new. In between these two points in time though, He still desires to appear to us who love and obey Him.

God doesn’t desire to remain far away from us. He instead went through such great pains to make Himself near to us, by providing a way for the things separating us from Him to be removed. He dealt with the divide between us and God, caused by our sin, by bearing the weight and consequences of our fault upon Himself, if we are only to put our trust in Him, turn from our old ways, and follow Him.

Now with such obstacles taken care of, we can live in the presence of our Lord. He tells us that He will not leave us orphans, but He will come to us (John 14:18). He tells us that as we are gathered in His name, He is in the midst of us (Matthew 18:20). And He says, to all who love Him and obey Him, that He will manifest Himself to them, and make His home within them (John 14:21, 23).

Jesus Christ appearing to us is so much deeper than just talking about Him, just reading the Bible, or performing some physical action. It’s the living resurrected Christ appearing before us, and His presence being in the midst of us.

Is there anything more precious, more to be desired, than this close and unbroken life with our Lord? I don’t think there is. And yet I so often fail to enter into the experience of this abiding fellowship. And, for that, I have to ask the question: do I love His appearing in my life? Do I have an unmatched love for Christ, that would choose Him over anything? Or am I content with religion and daily lifeless habits? Do I long for Him to appear to me to the point where I would gladly part with anything if it meant knowing Christ more? Or do I instead simply desire a life of comfort? Lord, make us to love Your appearing in our lives!

The Lord Jesus promises His presence to those that love Him (John 14:21, Matthew 7:7, Revelation 3:20). Would we have an earnest love for Him, and not simply a love for what blessings He gives. Would we love His appearing and be willing, if asked, to give anything for it.

<blockquote>“He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him… If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him.”<footer>John 14:21, 23</footer></blockquote>
