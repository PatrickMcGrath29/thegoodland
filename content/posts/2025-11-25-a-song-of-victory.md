> "Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ"\
> — 1 Corinthians 15:57

::poetry
A life of overcoming,\
A life of ceaseless praise,\
Be this thy blessed portion\
Throughout the coming days.\
The victory was purchased\
On Calvary's cross for thee,\
Sin shall not have dominion,\
The Son hath made thee free.

Made free by wondrous union\
In the death that Jesus died,\
Kept free, thy life now hidden\
In Him the Crucified.\
The precious blood of Jesus\
Hath never lost its power,\
Through it His saints still conquer\
In Satan's darkest hour.

And wouldst thou know the secret\
Of constant victory?\
Let in the Overcomer,\
And He will conquer thee!\
Thy broken spirit taken\
In sweet captivity,\
Shall glory in His triumph\
And share His victory.

Then from thy life ascending,\
One triumph note of praise\
(For they who always conquer\
A victor's song must raise)\
Shall echo on unceasing,\
Till Satan's host dost flee\
Before our glorious watchword\
"Lord, victory for me."

Though all the path before thee\
The host of darkness fill,\
Look to thy Father's promise,\
And claim the victory still.\
Faith sees the heavenly legions,\
Where doubt sees nought but foes,\
And through the very conflict\
Her life the stronger grows.

Still conquering and to conquer,\
The Jerichos _must_ fall,\
The mountains melt before him,\
And Christ be King o'er all.\
Faith grows in holy boldness,\
When everything seems lost,\
And where man says "Tis hopeless,"\
There loves to prove Him most.

More stern will grow the conflict\
As nears our King's return,\
And they alone can face it\
Who this great lesson learn:—\
That from them God asks nothing\
But to unlatch the door\
Admitting Him, who through them,\
Will conquer evermore.
