"Within the Veil."—Be this, belov’d, thy portion,\
Within the secret of thy Lord to dwell,\
Beholding Him, until thy face His glory,\
Thy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell.

"Within the Veil,"—for only as thou gazest\
Upon the matchless beauty of His face,\
Can’st thou become a living revelation\
Of His great heart of love, His untold grace.

"Within the Veil,"—there only in its fulness\
The loveliness of Christ our King is seen;\
There may thy spirit fall in adoration,\
Without a cloud, without a shade between.

"Within the Veil,"—O place of sweetest refuge,\
The storm may beat, the tempest rage without,\
The enemy assail with fierce temptation,\
Or seek to snare thee with some subtle doubt.

*Within*—all, all is peace and quiet stillness,\
For there the cruel tempter may not come,\
And on the bosom of thy Saviour folded,\
Thy soul hath found her everlasting home,

There drinking evermore of Life’s pure river,\
In fulness flowing from the Fountain head,\
Thou shalt the "earthen vessel" be this Treasure,\
The life and love of Christ, abroad to spread.

"Within the Veil," His fragrance poured upon thee,\
Without the Veil, that fragrance shed abroad,\
"Within the Veil," His Hand shall tune the music\
Which sounds on earth the praises of thy Lord.

"Within the Veil," thy spirit deeply anchored,\
Thou walkest calm above a world of strife,\
"Within the Veil" thy soul, with Him united,\
‘Shall live on earth His resurrection life.

"Within the Veil,"—Tongue cannot tell the glories\
Of Him, the "altogether lovely" One,\
Yet shalt thou know this mystery of glory,\
That Christ and His belov'd for aye are one.

"Within the Veil," there tarry, O beloved,\
To go no more for ever from His face,\
There take the uttermost His bounty giveth\
To magnify on earth His boundless grace.
