God held the world so dear that He gave His only begotten Son for everyone who will trust in Him. And how did He give Him? He gave Him in His birth as man, in order to be forever one with us. He gave Him in His death on the cross as surety, in order to take away our sin and curse. He gave Him on the throne of heaven, in order to arrange for our welfare, as our Representative and Intercessor over all the powers of heaven. He gave Him in the outpouring of the Spirit, in order to dwell in us—to be entirely and altogether our own. :tooltip{text="verses" content="John 1:14,16; 14:23; Rom. 5:8; 8:32,34; Eph. 1:22; 3:17; Col. 2:9-10; Heb. 7:24,26; 1 John 4:9-10"} Yes, that is the love of God. He gave His Son to us, for us, and in us.

Nothing less than His Son Himself. This is the love of God. It is not that He gives us something, but that He gives us Someone—a living person-not one or another blessing, but Him, who is all life and blessing—Jesus Himself. He does not simply give us forgiveness, revival, sanctification, or glory—He gives us His own Son, Jesus. The Lord Jesus is the beloved, the equal, the bosom friend, the eternal blessedness of the Father. And it is the will of God that we should have Jesus as ours, even as He has Him. :tooltip{text="verses" content="Matt. 11:27; John 17:23,25; Rom. 8:38,39; Heb. 2:11,Tim. 1:12"} For this reason He gave Him to us. The whole of salvation consists of this—to have, to possess, to enjoy Jesus. God has given His Son, given Him wholly to become ours. :tooltip{text="verses" content="Psalms 73:24; 142:6; John 20:28; Heb. 3:14"}

What do we have to do? To take Him, to receive and to take possession of the gift—to enjoy Jesus as our own. This is eternal life. “He that hath the Son hath life.” :tooltip{text="verses" content="John 1:12; 2 Cor. 3:5; Col. 2:6; 1 John 5:12"}

How I wish that all young Christians would understand this. The one great work of God’s love for us is, He gives us His Son. In Him we have all. Therefore, the one great work of our heart must be to receive this Jesus who has been given to us, and to consider and use Him as ours. I must begin every day anew with the thought, l have Jesus to do all for me. :tooltip{text="verses" content="John 15:5; Rom. 8:37; I Cor. 1:30; Eph. 1:3,2:10; Phil. 4:13"} In all weakness or darkness or danger—in the case of every desire or need—let your first thought always be, I have Jesus to make everything right for me. God has given Him to me for this purpose. Whether your need is forgiveness, consolation, or confirmation, remember, the Father gave you Jesus to care for you. Whether you have fallen, or are tempted to fall, into danger, remember, Jesus has been given to you for your care. Whether you do not know the will of God in one matter or another, or whether you are unsure of your strength and courage to do His will, remember, Jesus will care for you.

For this reason, rely every day on this gift from God. It has been presented to you in the Word. Appropriate the Son by faith in the Word. Take Him again every day. Through faith you have the Son. :tooltip{text="verses" content="John 1:12; 1 John 5:9,13"} The love of God has given the Son. Take Him and hold Him steadily in the love of your heart. :tooltip{text="verses" content="1 John 4:4,19"} It is to bring life, eternal life, to you that God has given Jesus. Take Him up into your life. Let your heart and tongue and whole walk be under the might and guidance of Jesus. :tooltip{text="verses" content="2 Cor. 5:15; Phil. 3:8"}

Young Christian, so weak and so sinful, please listen to that word. God has given you Jesus. He is yours. Taking is nothing else but the fruit of faith. The gift is for you. He will do all for you.

### Prayer

Lord Jesus, today and every day, I take You. In all Your fullness and in all Your relations, without ceasing, I take You for myself. You are my Wisdom, my Light, my Leader. I take You as my Prophet. You, who perfectly reconciles me and brings me near to God, who purifies and sanctifies me and prays for me, I take as my Priest. You, who guides and keeps and blesses me, I take as my King. You, Lord, are all, and You are wholly mine. Thanks be to God for His unspeakable gift. Amen.

### Points to remember

1. Often ponder the word “give.” God gives in a wonderful way—from the heart, completely and for nothing—to the unworthy. And He gives effectively. What He gives He will truly make our possession, inwardly and entirely. Believe this, and you will have the certainty that Jesus will come into your possession with all that He brings.
2. Also ponder the word “take.” Our great work is to take Jesus, to hold Him firmly, and to appropriate Him when received. That taking is nothing but trusting. He is mine with all that He has. The secret of the life of faith is to take Jesus—the full Jesus-as yours every day.
3. Let the word “have” weigh heavily with you. “He that hath the Son hath life” (1 John 5:12). What I have is mine, for my use and service. I can have the full enjoyment of it.
4. Especially notice what God gives and what you take. What you have now is nothing less than the living Son of God. Do you receive this?
