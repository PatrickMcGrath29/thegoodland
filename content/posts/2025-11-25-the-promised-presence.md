> "Certainly I will be with thee"\
> — Exodus 3:12

::poetry
Father, on this New Year's Morning,\
Let me hear Thy loving voice,\
Speaking gracious words and tender,\
Leading me to fresh surrender,—\
Let me hear Thee and rejoice.

"Certainly I will be with thee,"\
Thou hast all in having Me.\
Brings this year or joy or sorrow,\
Trust to-day, and leave to-morrow\
In the hand that leadeth thee.

"Certainly I will be with thee,"\
When the golden morning breaks,\
And to common toil and labour,\
Intercourse with friend and neighbour,\
Day by day thy soul awakes.

"Certainly I will be with thee,"\
As the hours speed on their way,\
Bearing for thee ev'ry worry,\
Guarding thee from fret or hurry,\
Teaching thee to trust alway.

"Certainly I will be with thee,"\
As the day draws to a close,\
Filling thee with holy gladness,\
Soothing pain and calming sadness\
With that peace the world ne'er knows.

"Certainly I will be with thee,"\
Ev'ry day throughout this year,\
Naught My faithfulness can alter,\
Though thy feet may tire and falter,\
I am with thee, do not fear.

'Tis enough, dear Lord, Thy message\
Meets my need whate'er it be.\
Love and grace in boundless measure,\
Christ my everlasting Treasure,\
Ev'ry want supplied in Thee.

Filled my soul to overflowing\
With the riches of Thy grace,\
I will rest in Thy salvation\
Till in joyful adoration\
I shall see Thee face to face.
