"How shall He not?" How often hast thou questioned,\
How shall He give this gift and that to me?\
How shall He satisfy my soul’s deep hunger?\
How shall His perfect peace my portion be?

How can He grant me rest amid life’s turmoil?\
How can He keep my feet from falling free?\
How can He give me victory in the conflict?\
Ah, surely such a life is not for me!

How shall He? Brother, sister, canst thou question\
The gracious promises of love divine,\
The while He tells thee, "Thou art ever with Me,\
And all I have, My child, for aye is thine.’"

How shall He? And He suffered to accomplish\
Thy full redemption from sin’s guilt and power;\
How shall He? While He waits with tender longing\
The fulness of His grace on thee to shower.

Nay, rather let thy trembling, doubting question\
Give place to faith’s glad note of trust and praise,\
How shall He not do all that He hath promised,\
And with His glory fill thine earthly days?

How shall He fail to keep the feet from falling\
That He hath ransomed from the ways of sin?\
How shall He not give peace and joy abounding\
Unto the soul He gave His life to win?

How shall He scorn an empty earthen vessel\
Laid in surrender at His pierced feet,\
How shall He fail to cleanse and fill and use it,\
Making it for His blessed service meet?

How shall He not baptize thee with His spirit,\
Who in thy soul hath wrought the deep desire\
That thy whole life might be one living offering,\
Consumed and burning with that sacred Fire?

Nay, soul, He yearns His very best to give thee,\
To do His highest, deepest work in thee,\
Henceforth live thou upon His love unbounded,\
And all His fulness shall thy portion be.
