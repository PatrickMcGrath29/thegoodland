"'Jesus Himself drew near'—Lord, as of old,\
Ere yet another New Year shall unfold,\
Do Thou Thyself draw near to be my Guide,\
And let me ever by Thy choice abide.\
Lord, since I long that Thou shouldst with me go,\
How to ensure Thy Presence I would know.”

"If thou wouldst have Me near thee, child, thy feet\
Must turn from slippery paths, and ways not meet\
For those that bear the Christian’s sacred name,\
For, if thy walk be careless, soon with shame\
And bitter grief, thou’lt find thyself alone,\
My Face hid from thee, all the sunshine gone.\
Then, too, if I ‘draw near,’ thy lips must be\
Truthful and loving, from harsh judgments free,\
Hushed all the murmurs discontent would raise,\
Lifting instead ‘the sacrifice of praise.’\
My child, thou know’st the joy of sins forgiven,\
Be not content to go alone to heaven;\
But seek to show in life, in word and deed\
That thou hast found Me ‘satisfy’ indeed.\
So with each power of body, mind and soul,\
Thy will surrendered, all ’neath My control,\
I’ll use thee for My glory. Then this year\
T'will be each day, ‘Jesus Himself drew near\
And went with them.’ The future in My Hand\
Can’st thou not leave? Content to have Me stand\
Beside thee at the dawning of each day,\
And walk beside thee, brightening all thy way.\
I only seek thus to possess thee, child,\
That I may guard thee pure and undefiled\
Amid the sin around. That I may bless,\
And pour upon thee love and tenderness\
Which must on earth be hidden from the soul,\
That yields but half to Me, and not the whole.\
Trust thyself to Me: so o’er paths of ease,\
Or stony ways, all shall be ‘paths of peace.'"

“Lord, Thy conditions gladly I’d fullfil,\
Now would surrender all unto Thy will,\
Content that Thou shouldst plan for me each day,\
If only Thou go with me all the way.”’
