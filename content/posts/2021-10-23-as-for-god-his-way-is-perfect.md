title: As for God, His way is perfect
summary: As for God, His way is perfect. Do we believe this? Oh Lord, would it
  be that we would really believe that Your way is perfect. He is the grand
  Architect of the universe, who created all things by speaking them into
  existence. He is also the God who has numbered all of the hairs on our heads,
  knowing us deeper than we even know ourselves.

<blockquote>As for God, His way is perfect; The word of the Lord is proven; He is a shield to all who trust in Him. For who is God, except the Lord? And who is a rock, except our God? It is God who arms me with strength, And makes my way perfect. He makes my feet like the feet of deer, And sets me on my high places.<footer>Psalm 18:30-33</footer></blockquote>

As for God, His way is perfect. Do we believe this? Oh Lord, would it be that we would really believe that Your way is perfect. He is the grand Architect of the universe, who created all things by speaking them into existence. He is also the God who has numbered all of the hairs on our heads, knowing us deeper than we even know ourselves. And He in fact has a way for us, a way that is perfect. These verses start by saying that "His way is perfect", and soon after it says "it is God who ... makes my way perfect".

How wonderful is it that we can believe in and entrust ourselves to such a mighty and caring God, who tenderly leads us in His perfect ways for our life. He is the Good Shepherd who cares for us, His dearly beloved sheep. As a shepherd would guide and protect his sheep, so He desires to do so for us.

When we begin to entrust ourselves to Him then we can really experience such a deep peace, as all of the burdens that we would otherwise be anxious about are turned over to Him, for Him to manage. And He does desire that we come to Him with our cares and burdens. In 1 Peter 5:7 it says "casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you".

Lord Jesus, we thank you that Your way is perfect. And we thank you that, as our Shepherd, you will lead us in these ways. We fully entrust ourselves to You today.
