We find the meaning of the institution of baptism summarized in these words. The word “teach” means, “make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them.” The believing disciple, as he is baptized in the water, is also to be baptized or introduced into the name of the triune God.

By the name of the Father, the new birth and life as a child in the love of the Father are secured to him. :tooltip{text="references (1)" content="Gal. 3:26,27; 4:67"} By the name of the Son, participation in the forgiveness of sins and the life that is in Christ are promised to him.:tooltip{text="references (2)" content=" Col. 2:12"} By the name of the Holy Spirit, the indwelling and progressive renewal of the Spirit are assured him.:tooltip{text="references (3)" content=" Tit. 3:5,6"} And every baptized believer must always look upon baptism as his entrance into a covenant with the triune God, and as a pledge that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit will, in course of time, do for him all that they have promised. It requires a lifelong study to know and enjoy all the blessing that is presented in baptism.

In other passages of Scripture, the blessing is again set forth. We find bound up with it the new birth required to make a child of God. “Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God” (John 3:5). The baptized disciple has in God a Father, and he has to live as a child in the love of this Father.4

Then, again, baptism is brought more directly into connection with the redemption that is in Christ. Consequently, the first and simplest representation of it is the forgiveness or washing away of sins. Forgiveness is always the gateway or entrance into all blessing. Therefore, baptism is also the antitype in the beginning of the Christian life---a beginning that is maintained through the whole life. It is on this account that in Romans, chapter 6, baptism is represented as the secret of the whole of sanctification, the entrance into a life in union with Jesus. “Know ye not that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?” (Romans 6:3). The more precise explanation of what it is to be baptized into the death of Jesus, and to arise out of this with Him, for a new life in Him follows in verses 4-11. This is very powerfully comprehended elsewhere in this word, “As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ” (Galatians 3:27). This alone is the right life of a baptized disciple. He has put on Christ.5 As one is plunged into water and passes under it, so is the believing confessor baptized into the death of Christ, in order then to live and walk clothed with the new life of Christ.

And there are other passages where again the promise of the Spirit is connected with baptism. It is promised not only as the Spirit of regeneration but also as the gift from heaven bestowed on believers for indwelling and sealing — for progressive renewal. “He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, which He shed on us abundantly” (Titus 3:5,6). Here, renewal is the activity of the Spirit, by which the new life that is planted in the new birth penetrates our whole being, so that all our thinking and doing is sanctified by Him.6

And all this rich blessing which lies in baptism is received by faith. “He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved.” Baptism was not only a confession on man's part of the faith that he already had, but equally a seal on God's part for the confirmation of faith--a covenant sign in which the whole treasury of grace lay open, to be enjoyed throughout life. As often as a baptized believer sees a baptism administered, or reflects on it, it is to be to him an encouragement to press, by an ever-growing faith, into the full life of salvation that the triune God desires to work in him. The Holy Spirit is given to appropriate within us all the love of the Father and all the grace of the Son. The believing candidate for baptism is baptized into the death of Christ and has put on Christ. The Holy Spirit is in the disciple to give him all this as his daily experience.7

> Lord God, make Your holy baptism always operative in my soul as the experience that I am baptized into the death of Christ. And let Your people everywhere understand by Your Spirit what rich blessing lies in this baptism. Amen.
