The Lord teaches us to humble ourselves and to hear His voice. If we are not broken and beyond our selfish selves, we cannot shepherd others, and we might be doing more harm than good. 

Peter’s experience, including his failure and restoration by our gentle, merciful Lord, was so precious. Initially, Peter was not a shepherd despite his big personality and natural leadership. It was after the Lord restored him at the beach (John 21) that he became a shepherd.  This happened after Peter’s tremendous failures, his denial of the Lord three times, considering himself totally disqualified to serve the Lord and going back to fishing. Peter was humbled, broken, restored, heard the voice of the Lord, and experienced how gentle the Lord is to His sheep. The LORD gently gathered Peter back, and Peter became a shepherd. Strictly speaking, it is the Holy Spirit who is shepherding. In 1 Peter, Peter exuded such confidence about the living hope through resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit for the salvation of our souls, because he experienced God and believed the word of God.

How about us? Many times, when we have failures, we disqualify ourselves from serving the LORD, But the LORD wants us to be broken, restored, and hear the voice of our great Shepherd, so we can shepherd others.
