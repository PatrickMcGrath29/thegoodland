> **“For we all stumble in many ways.” — James 3:2** 

This word of God through James describes what man is — even the Christian — when he is not kept by grace. It reminds us to put away all confidence in ourselves.
 *(Romans 7:14, 23; Galatians 6:1)*

**“Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.” — Jude 24–25** 

This word from Jude points us to the One who can keep us from falling, stirring our hearts to ascribe to Him the honor and the power. It strengthens our hope in God.
 *(2 Corinthians 1:9; 1 Thessalonians 5:24; 2 Thessalonians 2:16–17; 3:3)*

**“Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble.” — 2 Peter 1:10** 

This word from Peter teaches us the way to partake in God’s keeping power: by confirming our calling and election through a godly walk (see vv. 4, 8, 11). It calls us to diligence and careful watchfulness.
 *(Matthew 26:41; Luke 12:35; 1 Peter 1:13; 5:8–10)*

### **How Should a Young Christian Think About Stumblings?**

For a young believer, it is often difficult to know what to think of his stumblings. On this point, he must be especially careful to avoid two errors.

Some become **discouraged** when they stumble: they think their surrender to God was not sincere, and lose their confidence toward Him.
 *(Hebrews 3:6, 14; 10:35)*

Others take it **too lightly**. They think it cannot be otherwise, pay little attention to their failures, and continue to live carelessly.
 *(Romans 6:1; Galatians 2:18; 3:3)*

Let us take these words of God to teach us how we should think about our stumblings. There are three lessons.

### **1. Let No Stumbling Discourage You**

You are called to maturity, to perfection — yet this does not happen all at once. Time and patience are needed for growth. Therefore James says:

**“And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.” — James 1:4** 

*(Matthew 5:48; 2 Timothy 3:17; Hebrews 13:20–21; 1 Peter 5:10)*

Do not think your surrender was insincere; simply acknowledge how weak you still are. And do not think you must go on stumbling; acknowledge how strong your Savior is.

### **2. Let Stumbling Drive You to Faith in the Mighty Keeper**

It is because you have not relied on Him with full faith that you have stumbled.
 *(Matthew 14:31; 17:20)*

Let each stumbling draw you closer to Him. The first thing you should do when you stumble is to **go to Jesus with it**. Tell Him everything.

**“I confess my iniquity; I am full of anxiety because of my sin.” — Psalm 38:18**
 **“You have taken account of my wanderings; put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your book?” — Psalm 56:8**
 **“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” — 1 John 1:9**
 **“And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” — 1 John 2:1**

Confess your failure and receive His forgiveness. Confess it and commit your weakness to Him, trusting that He will keep you. Keep singing continually in your heart:

“To Him who is mighty to keep you, be the glory!”

### **3. Let Stumbling Make You Watchful and Wise**

**“How blessed is the man who fears the Lord always, but he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity.” — Proverbs 28:14**
 *(Philippians 2:12; 1 Peter 1:17–18)*

By faith, strive and overcome. In the strength of your Keeper, and in the joy and confidence of His help, you will gain courage to stay alert. The more firmly you rest in your calling and election — knowing that He has chosen you and will not let you go — the more carefully you will walk before Him, living **for Him, in Him, and through Him**.
 *(2 Chronicles 20:15; Psalm 18:30, 37; 44:5, 9; John 5:4–5; Romans 11:20; 2 Corinthians 1:24; Philippians 2:13)*

Doing this, God’s word assures you, **you will never stumble.**

### **A Prayer**

> Lord Jesus, a sinner ready to stumble at every moment would give glory to You, who are mighty to keep from stumbling. Yours is the power and the strength. I take You as my Keeper. I rest in Your love which has chosen me, and wait for the fulfillment of Your promise: “You will never stumble.” Amen.

### **Practical Reflections**

1. Let your thoughts about what the grace of God can do for you come only from the Word of God. Our natural expectation — that we must always keep stumbling — is wrong. It is strengthened by several things:

\-A hidden unwillingness to surrender all.

\-The example of many careless Christians.

\-Unbelief that doubts whether God will truly keep us.

\-The discouragement of repeated failures when striving in our own strength.

2. Let no stumbling be tolerated because it seems small or insignificant.
