> "He satisfies... and fills"\
> — Psalm 107:10

::poetry
Art thou hungering for the fulness\
Of the blessing Christ doth give?\
Longing now to learn the secret\
Of the life He bids thee live?\
In His word thine answer standeth,\
"CHRIST WHO IS OUR LIFE," it saith,\
Open now thy heart, and trust Him\
There to dwell, henceforth, "by faith."

Christ, the Lord’s anointed, reigning\
O'er the life He died to win,\
Daily shall reveal more fully\
His great power without, within.\
What _thou_ never could'st accomplish\
Shall His Spirit work thro' thee,\
While thy soul this witness beareth,\
"'Tis not _I_, but Christ in me."

"In Him" dwelleth all God’s fulness,\
"In Him" thou art made complete,\
Rise, and claim thy heavenly birthright,\
Kneeling at thy Father’s feet.\
He will never disappoint thee,\
Praise Him that the gift _is_ thine,\
Then go forth to live each moment\
On sufficiency Divine.

Lord, I come,—and simply resting\
On Thy faithful changeless Word,\
I believe the Blood doth cleanse me,\
And that Christ is crowned Lord.\
Grant henceforth a ceaseless outflow\
Of Thy life and love through me,\
Reaching those who sit in darkness,\
Winning priceless souls to Thee.
