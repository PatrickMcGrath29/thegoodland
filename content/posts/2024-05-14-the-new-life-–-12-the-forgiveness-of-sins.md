 In connection with surrender to the Lord, it was said that the first great blessing of the grace of God was this--the free, complete, everlasting forgiveness of all your sins. For the young Christian, it is of great importance that he should stand firm in this forgiveness of his sins. He should always carry the certainty of it about with him. For this reason, he must especially consider the following truths.

The forgiveness of our sin is a complete forgiveness. :tooltip{text="verses" content="Ps. 103:12; Isa. 38:17; 55:7; Mic. 7:18,19; Heb. 10:16-18"} God does not partially forgive. Even with man, we believe that half forgiveness is not true forgiveness. The love of God is so great, and the atonement in the blood of Jesus so complete and powerful, that God always forgives completely. Take time with God’s Word so that you may fully understand that your guilt has been blotted out completely. God absolutely thinks no more about your sins. “I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” :tooltip{text="verses" content="Jer. 31:34; Heb. 8:12; 10:17"}

The forgiveness of our sin restores us entirely again to the love of God. :tooltip{text="verses" content="Hos. 14:5; Luke 15:22; Acts 26:18; Rom. 5:1,5"} Not only does God no longer attribute us with sin, but He also restores us to the righteousness of Jesus--for His sake we are as dear to God as He is. Not only is wrath turned away from us, but the fullness of love now rests upon us. “I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him” (Hosea 14:4). Forgiveness is the access to all of God’s love. On this account, forgiveness is also an introduction to all the other blessings of redemption.

Live in the full assurance of forgiveness, and let the Spirit fill your heart with the certainty and the blessedness of it. Then you will have great confidence in expecting all from God. Learn from the Word of God--through the Spirit-to know God correctly, and to trust Him as the ever-forgiving God. That is His name and His glory. To one to whom much, yes, all is forgiven, He will also give much. He will give all. :tooltip{text="verses" content="Ps. 103:3; Isa. 12:1,3; Rom. 5:10; 8:32; Eph. 1:7; 3:5"} Therefore, let it be your joyful thanksgiving every day. “Bless the Lord, O my soul, who forgiveth all thine iniquities.” Then forgiveness becomes the power of a new life. “Her sins which are many, are forgiven: for she loved much” (Luke 7:47). The forgiveness of sins, received in living faith every day, is a bond which binds you to Jesus and His service. :tooltip{text="verses" content="John 13:14,l5; Rom. 12:1; 1 Cor. 6:20; Eph. 5:25,26; Tit.2:l4; 1 Pet. 1:17,18"}

Then, the forgiveness of former sins supplies the courage to immediately confess every new sin and to trustfully receive forgiveness.6 Look, however, to one thing-the certainty of forgiveness must not be a matter of memory or understanding, but must be the fruit of life. It must be our living relationship with the forgiving Father and with Jesus in whom we have forgiveness. :tooltip{text="verses" content="Eph. 2:13,18; Phil 3:9; Col. 1:21,22"} It is not enough to know that I once received forgiveness. My life in the love of God, my living communion with Jesus by faith--this makes the forgiveness of sin again always new and powerful. It is the joy and the life of my soul.

Prayer

Lord God, this is the wonder of Your grace--that You are a forgiving God. Teach me everyday to know in this the glory of Your love. Let the Holy Spirit seal forgiveness to me as a blessing, everlasting, ever fresh, living, and powerful. And let my life be like a song of thanksgiving. “Bless the Lord, O my soul, who forgiveth all thine iniquities.” Amen.



Notes

1. Forgiveness is one with justification. Forgiveness is the word that looks more to the relation of God as Father. Justification looks more to His acquittal as Judge. Forgiveness is a word that is more easily understood by the young Christian. But he must also endeavour to understand the word justification and to become familiar with all that the Scriptures teach about it.
2. About justification we must understand:

\-That man in himself is totally unrighteous;

\-That he cannot be justified by works, that is, pronounced righteous before the judgement seat of the Father;

\-That Christ Jesus has brought righteousness for our sake. His obedience is our righteousness;

\-That we, through faith, receive Him, are united with Him, and then are pronounced righteous before God;

\-That we, through faith, have the certainty of this, and, as justified, draw near to God;

\-That union with Jesus is a life by which we are not only pronounced righteous, but are truly righteous and act righteously.

3. Let the certainty of your part in justification, in the full forgiveness of your sins, and full restoration to the love of God, be your confidence in drawing near to God every day.
