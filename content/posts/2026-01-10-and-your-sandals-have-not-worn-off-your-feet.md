The period the Israelites were in the wilderness is not thoroughly described in the books of Exodus through Deuteronomy but it’s very clearly shown that God‘s presence was with the Israelites: protecting them, sustaining them and above all teaching them to hear His voice!
There are several important lessons that the people of Israel had to learn during this 40-year period, and one of them was to trust and depend on God above everything. Relying on Him for the very basic, everyday needs of food and water. God promised them that Hhe will supply “manna from heaven” which will be given to them day to day.

> “Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.”\
> — Exodus 16:4

This continuous dependence on God was one of the principles they had to work on. They were used to always turning to Moses for any problems and complaints they had, instead of turning to God Himself daily. How miraculously God provided them with water out of dry land. There are multiple occasions where we read about their complaints and murmuring, but God was still there: Giving them water out of the rock (Exodus: 17:1-7), turning bitter streams to sweet ones (Exodus: 15:22-25), even leading them to an oasis; a place of refreshing abundance (Exodus: 15:27).

> “He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.”\
> — Psalm 105:41

In tough times, their faith was strengthened by clinging unto the word of God. Moments of hardships were the Lord’s mercy in order to purify their hearts. How we need our Lord to transform us and lead us to holiness! It’s a process that is painful, but like a gentle surgeon He goes through the dark spots of our hearts in order to clean them for His glory! Their faith was finally grounded, as they became entrusted in the faithfulness of God. Not His miracles, not the practical supply, but His faithfulness. Aren’t we in the same process of learning to trust His faithfulness? The Bible says “For we walk by faith, not by sight.” (2 Cor. 5:7); trusting God’s promises and guidance and the things not yet seen.                                                                                                                                                      

> “So He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord.”\
> — Deuteronomy 8:3

> “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”\
> — Hebrews 4:12

Lastly, the people of Israel learned from experience that “All things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.” [Romans: 8.28] And yes! They were called to be His people, they were called according to His purpose. And there was light at the end of the tunnel. They got to know their God as a Shepherd. Not only as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But they learned to recognize His still, small voice of guidance and to have a personal relationship with Him. That’s such a wonderful picture for us too. Our journey with the Lord starts from our personal relationship with Him. The Lord cannot use us for His church if He doesn’t first work on our untransformed character. But that’s part of His beautiful plan for our life. May we also be the people who “…served the Lord all their days …and who had known all the works of the Lord which He had done for them.” (Joshua: 24:31)
