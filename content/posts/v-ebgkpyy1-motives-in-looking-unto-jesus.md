*The following text comes from the book Looking Unto Jesus, by Isaac Ambrose*

- - -

To quicken us to this duty; I shall put forward some moving considerations: ponder and weigh them with an impartial judgment. Who knows, but through the assistance of Christ, they may prove effectual with your hearts, and make you to resolve upon this excellent duty of looking unto Jesus.

Consider, our riches, in case we are lively in this duty, \[looking unto Jesus].

That Christ gives a taste of His goodness unto them. They cannot look unto Him, but he makes them joyful with the feeling of Himself and Spirit; and hence it is that many times they break out into “psalms, and hymns and spiritual songs, and make melody in their hearts unto the Lord,” (Ephesians 5:19) . O, there is a goodness of illumination, regeneration, sanctification, consolation, pacification, and spiritual freedom flowing from Christ to the souls of His saints, which to carnal men is a sealed well, whose waters their palates never tasted.

That Christ gives a sincere and inward love of Himself unto their hearts. No sooner is their eye of faith of looking unto Jesus but presently their heart is all on fire. Such a suitableness is between Christ and their souls, as is between the hearts of lovers; their love to Christ is like the love of Jonathan to David, a wonderful love, and “passing the love of women,” (2 Samuel 1:26) . They love Him as the bridegroom to whom their souls are married, as the choicest pearl by whom they are enriched, as the sun of consolation, by whose beams their souls are comforted, as the fountain by whom their hearts are refreshed, and their desires every way satisfied.

That Christ gives the sense of his own love to them; they cannot look on Christ but they see Him loving, and embracing their humble souls: they see Him binding up their broken hearts: they behold Him gathering to Himself, and bearing in the bosom of His love, and comforting with the promises of His word their wounded spirits: they behold, Him like Jacob, serving in the heat and in the cold for Rachel; serving in manifold afflictions, from His cradle to His cross, to make a spouse unto Himself.

Come, let the proud man boast in his honor, and the mighty man is his valor, and the rich man in his wealth, but let the Christian pronounce himself happy, only happy, truly happy, fully happy in beholding Christ, enjoying Christ, having Christ, in looking unto Jesus.
