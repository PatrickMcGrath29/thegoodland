*“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.”* (John 10:11)
::

What a blessing that the Lord Himself is our Shepherd. We were lost, hurt, and wandering in the wilderness, but the Lord sought each one of us, calling us by name and bringing us into the one small flock of His, into His House.

### MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE

From the very beginning, God has been a speaking God. In Genesis 1:3, *“Then God said…”*—and the world came into existence. Everything began with His voice. He always desires to speak to His people. But the question is—are we listening?

The Lord speaks with a gentle and clear voice, never forceful or demanding. Yet if all the other noises in our lives are not quieted, His voice can easily be drowned out. That’s why we must make room for the Lord, giving the Lord His rightful place in our hearts. When we choose to prioritize His voice, He helps us do it. The Lord is faithful to draw near when we make space for Him.

But hearing His voice isn’t just about the words—it’s also about the tone of His voice. The way He speaks with Life, Compassion, Patience and Love. Think about how we grow close to a friend. We talk to them every day, learn their likes and dislikes, notice the tone in their voice, and soon they become familiar. That’s how a relationship works—it’s built through daily closeness. In the same way, the sheep must hear the Shepherd’s voice every day, or else they will wander.

In 1 Samuel 3:10, we read, *“Now the Lord came and stood and called as at other times, ‘Samuel! Samuel!’ And Samuel answered, ‘Speak, for Your servant hears.’”* That is the posture of a heart that hears God—ready to listen, waiting patiently, eager to respond. May our hearts be just like Samuel’s—simple, willing, and desiring to hear the Lord’s voice. Lord help us!

At the end of it all, this is what the Good Shepherd desires most: That His sheep would live close to His heart, guided by His voice, and shaped by His love—a people who not only know His words but know His heart.

### THE CHARACTER OF THE GOOD SHEPHERD

If we are to truly know the Shepherd, we must know about Him—His heart, His character, and the way He cares for His flock. This is not just head knowledge; it is an experience of His heart, a personal encounter with Him.

***1. He is The Humble Shepherd***

Shepherding was considered a lowly job. Shepherds lived among their sheep, not minding the dirt or the smell. They cared for their flock with love and faithfulness. The good shepherd is patient, gentle, and never giving up. Sheep, on the other hand, are dumb, helpless and often wander off—they need constant guidance and patience, its full dependence on the Shepherd, for even the smallest things like to drink water or to get back home, else they wander and get lost. It’s nice to see the sheep’s personality too, they are so simple, not very talented animals and their world is very small with simple things, like grazing in the fields, following the shepherd where he leads and resting back in their places. 

***2. He is The Selfless Shepherd***

He desires a flock that reflects His selfless, loving, and obedient nature. To follow Him, we must be freed from our own flesh and selfish desires, even what seems “good” in us. In Matthew 16:21–23, when Jesus spoke of His coming death and resurrection, Peter said, *“Far be it from You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!”* Out of his love and care for Jesus, Peter wanted what he thought was best, as most of us don’t want our loved ones to get hurt, but Jesus immediately recognized that his thoughts came from the flesh and said, *“Get behind Me, Satan.”* The Lord calls us to align our hearts and minds with His, even when it goes against our natural instincts.

***3. He is The Shepherd of Obedience***

He invites us into purposeful obedience—where the head and the body move together in unity. The bond between the Shepherd and His flock is formed through His voice and relationship. True obedience comes from love, not fear. The Lord is after our character, not our comfort. He doesn’t just want us to have an easy life—He wants to shape us into His likeness.

***4. He is The Loving Shepherd***

*“Foolish oft I strayed, but yet with His love He sought me.”*

Unlike hired shepherds, who are motivated by wages and bound by limits—they work certain hours and escape when danger comes—the Good Shepherd’s motivation is love. He does not leave His flock, He protects from wolves, leads us to green pastures and knows the condition of every sheep. He stays. He calls us into His home, even though the sheep are not very pleasant to live with but He carries us close to His heart. This is His very nature—“Heart Hold.” John understood this intimacy deeply; he rested his head on Jesus’ bosom. We, too, have this access to His heart and are called to draw near and find our rest there.

***6. He is The Shepherd Who Feeds and Gathers***

The Shepherd’s heart is to gather, restore, and feed His flock. He nourishes us through His Word and His compassion. As Matthew 9:36 says, *“He had compassion on them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.”* May we carry the same compassion, for once we were lost and now we are found because of Him—and we don’t want any sheep to be lost. His compassion flows into us and through us, enabling us to care for others. Even when Peter failed, Jesus restored him. He asked, *“Do you love me?”* and then said, *“Feed My sheep.”* With whatever little love we have, He can work through us to serve and care for others.

The final fulfillment will be one Shepherd and one flock:
one Bride with one Bridegroom,
one Head with one Body,
one Flock with one Shepherd.
