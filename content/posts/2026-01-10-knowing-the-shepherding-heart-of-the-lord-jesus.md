### Our Need to Know Him

As followers of the Lord Jesus there is nothing more important than knowing the heart and the nature of the Lord Jesus. If we are to follow the Lord Jesus, if we are to walk in His steps, then it is essential for us to have a growing knowledge of the Lord Jesus. The twelve disciples frequently referred to the Lord Jesus as their Rabbi. It was the responsibility of a disciple to spend time with their rabbi, to observe him and to learn of him, so that they might grow up into him. It is the same for us as disciples of the Lord Jesus. The essence of the Christian life lies in growing in the knowledge of the person of the Lord Jesus. "Let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD" (Jeremiah 9:24). "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent" (John 17:3).

Let us have a renewed conviction that we must know the Lord Jesus. Above everything else we must—I must—know Him. We must have this deep, growing, personal knowledge of the Lord Jesus.

As we consider the great need of knowing the Lord Jesus, we see Him revealing something great about His nature in the Word. The Lord Jesus speaks of Himself as the Good Shepherd, the Shepherd over His flock.

### Knowing Him as the Good Shepherd

> "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep. But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them. The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep."\
> — John 10:11–13

The Lord Jesus loves and deeply cares for His sheep. With man, there is a point when your love for another will run out. When someone betrays you, lies to you, or wounds you one too many times you reach a breaking point and give up, just like the hireling who left the sheep when pressed by the sight of the wolf. But the love of the Lord Jesus never runs out. There is no limit to His love. "Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end" (John 13:1).

The Lord Jesus has an individual love for each of His sheep. Ninety-nine may be safe in His fold, but if even one is lost He will find no rest until He gathers up that sheep and brings it home. How this differs from mankind, where we are unfortunately so quick to disregard that one who is lost. But in truth we were once that one lost sheep, hopelessly far from God, and the Lord Jesus sought us out and brought us home upon His shoulders.

> And Jesus, when He came out, saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. So He began to teach them many things. When the day was now far spent, His disciples came to Him and said, “This is a deserted place, and already the hour is late. Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.” But He answered and said to them, “You give them something to eat.”\
> — Mark 6:34–37

How wonderful, to here see the compassion that the Lord Jesus had on the multitude, a people like sheep having no shepherd. If a sheep is separated from its shepherd it’ll wander aimlessly, and have no protection against those that would come against it. Seeing the multitude as sheep without a shepherd, the Lord Jesus drew near and “He began to teach them many things”. The Lord Jesus loved these people, and gave of Himself to help and serve them.

As our hearts cry out with a yearning to know the Lord Jesus, we see in Him a perfect shepherding love for others. We see His patience. We see His tenderness. Oh, we see how far He was willing to go to save His sheep. We see a perfect Shepherd.

Lord Jesus, I see You. I see Your perfect Shepherding heart. I see Your love outpoured upon me, an unworthy sinner, slain that I might have life. I see Your compassion, that drove You after me, that one lost sheep. I see the burden that You have for the lost, wandering, and hungry. Lord Jesus, I want to be like You.

### Growing up into the Head—Christ

After the Lord Jesus had spent the day teaching the multitude and the day was far spent, the disciples suggested that He send the people away so that they might buy food for themselves. But instead of sending the people away, the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, "You give them something to eat." What a wonderful word that the Lord Jesus says to us—"You give them something to eat." He was bringing His disciples into the work of shepherding and serving.

There were five thousand men gathered, perhaps also with women and children. The disciples themselves only had five loaves of bread and two fish—it wouldn't nearly be enough to feed the multitude. In this we see a great lesson. The Lord Jesus brings us into this life of shepherding, but of ourselves we have no capacity to shepherd one another appropriately. We are like the disciples, with five loaves and two fish before a multitude of people. Everything that we have of ourselves is hopelessly insufficient for the need before us.And so how then are we to move on? How then are we to meet such a great need? It is only through the Lord Jesus. As the disciples presented the five loaves and two fish to the Lord Jesus, so we need to present the little that we have—which is really just our willing heart—to Him. And as we present ourselves to Him, He lives out His life as the Good Shepherd within us, and becomes within us everything that we need to appropriately serve and shepherd others. It is needful for us to take the Lord Jesus's words in John 15 to heart, that apart from Him we can truly do nothing. But as we abide in Him, our lives will bear much fruit that is well pleasing to Him,

In Paul's letter to the church in Ephesus he tells us that God's intention is that we "may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ" (Ephesians 4:15). The Lord Jesus reveals Himself to us as the Good Shepherd. With the indwelling life of Christ in us, we are now to grow up into Him who is the Head—the Good Shepherd.

The Lord Jesus calls us into such a life of loving shepherding. Hear His voice, “You give them something to eat.” It begins with this sight of the Good Shepherd, the unveiling of His very own heart. And as we draw near to Him, and see more of His heart, we also realize that He will live out His own life in us, as the Good Shepherd, and be the fullness of what we need to serve others. He alone is the Good Shepherd, and it is only through the life of the Good Shepherd lived out in His people that they will be shepherd appropriately.

> The King of Love my Shepherd is, Whose goodness faileth never; I nothing lack if I am His And He is mine forever.
> 
> \
> Where streams of living water flow My ransomed soul He leadeth, And where the verdant pastures grow With food celestial feedeth.
>
> \
> Perverse and foolish oft I strayed, But yet in love He sought me, And on His shoulder gently laid, And home rejoicing brought me.
