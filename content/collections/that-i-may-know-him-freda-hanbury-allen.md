author: Freda Hanbury Allen
summary: >
  Freda Hanbury Allen’s "That I May Know Him" is a wonderful meditation on the
  believer’s deep longing to truly know Christ—not just intellectually, but
  intimately and experientially. Drawing from the Apostle Paul’s words in
  Philippians 3:10, Allen speaks of the beauty and cost of a life wholly devoted
  to Christ, shaped by His sufferings, and transformed by His resurrection
  power. This timeless work invites readers into deeper fellowship with the
  Lord, stirring a hunger for communion that goes beyond doctrine into the
  depths of relationship.
