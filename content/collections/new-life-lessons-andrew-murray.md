summary: >-
  Andrew Murray was born in 1828 in South Africa, where he lived most of his
  life. A faithful servant of God, he was greatly used by the Lord, not only
  during his life but even until now through his writings. As a young believer,
  Watchman Nee was greatly helped by Murray’s books and recommended them.

  <b>

  These short lessons were written by Andrew Murray for new disciples of Jesus. They are simple, basic but VERY important. Whether we are new in the Lord’s path or we’ve been there for years, these truths need to be engraved in our hearts and our understanding, not only for ourselves but also to be able to help others.

  <b>

  Some of the lessons are more basic, some are more advanced. The language is simple and easy to understand, and while each lesson is rather short, there are substantial Scripture references for further study. Let each reader receive according to their capacity and growth level, as the Lord confirms His truths in the heart. He is  our Good Shepherd, and He knows how to give us our “portion of food at the proper time”.
