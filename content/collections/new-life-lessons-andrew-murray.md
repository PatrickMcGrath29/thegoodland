summary: >-
  The New Life aids Christians in their examination of the scripture and offers
  valuable information to believers who want to overcome sin and live the
  Christian life. While Murray's book is specifically designed for young
  converts, the text is useful to all Christians. Murray's chapters cover a
  variety of different topics that Christians, particularly those new to the
  faith, will find remarkably helpful. Murray discusses how Christians should
  approach the tasks of missionary work, prayer, confession, and baptism. The
  text also provides practical guidance regarding money, self-denial,
  discretion, and the temptations of worldly evil.



  New Life is a personal devotional, but it is also a resourceful tool for large congregations, small groups, and prayer meetings. The text is simply and easy to understand, and while each individual entry is rather short, Murray supplies substantial scriptural reference for further exploration.
